<h3><span class="pb" id="Pgix">[pg ix]</span>DAWN OF A NEW ERA</h3>

<p>Many critics and some friends of
Mahatma Gandhi have found fault with
his desire to introduce simpler methods of
spinning and weaving and to do away with
much of the complicated machinery of
Modern Civilisation. The reason why they
object is that they fear such methods mean
not progress towards a higher state but
relapse into a primitive condition of civilisation
or even of barbarism. His denunciation
of the age of machinery and of the
Industrial System has been criticised by
many as the ravings of a visionary and of
one who is merely an impracticable idealist.
This is a strange criticism to come from
those who give their allegiance to a form
of civilisation or 'Culture' which has led
to the unprecedented horrors of the late
European War and the century-old disgraces
<span class="pb" id="Pgx">[pg x]</span>
of the Industrial System. Is this
present modern civilisation so very desirable
that we should wish it to continue in perpetuity?
Every civilisation in the History
of Man has reached a certain point after
which there has been one possibility only
for it and that was absolute relapse into
semi-darkness in order to give place to a new
and higher civilisation. The common starting
point of all the civilisations is a kind
of night-time. In order that the Babylonian
(or Despotic) Civilisation might give
way to the Roman (or Heroic), and the
Roman give way to the Modern (or Intellectual)
Civilisation, it was necessary for
each in turn to sink completely into this
common night-time. Without this entire
destruction of the ancient structure, there
would have been only a patchwork of the
old, and not a harmonious building of the
New. As Christ said: "Ye cannot put old
wine into new bottles." The debris of the
Past has to be cleared away in order to make
way for the structure of the Future. Now
with regard to Modern Civilisation, all the
signs of the times show that it has failed
<span class="pb" id="Pgxi">[pg xi]</span>
lamentably and is gradually tottering to a
dishonoured grave. Why make any attempts
to prop up what Nature so evidently has
decided to throw on the scrap-heap? Such
attempts are contrary to the teaching of
past history. But anything, which tends
to reach the common roots of all civilisations,
should be encouraged. In order that
the spiritual civilisation of the Future
may have a real chance of growing in an
atmosphere congenial to it, Mahatma
Gandhi's demonstration of the right path
should be welcomed. His emphasis on
simplicity of life and on the simplification
of the machinery of living must be realised
as a supremely essential condition of the
coming of the new Era. In the civilisation
of the Future, an Era of natural harmonious
living will be inaugurated, and artificial,
luxurious and pompous living will be
entirely rooted out.</p>

<p>Simplicity of life being a condition of
spiritual perfection, we may look forward
to an Era of Civilisation in the Future,
greatly superior to all the civilisations of
the Past, if only we accept simplicity of
<span class="pb" id="Pgxii">[pg xii]</span>
life as the best method of living. The
failure and decline of Western or Modern
Civilisation need not alarm us; for the
experience of History is full of similar
declines of once powerful cultures. When
Babylonian Civilisation had reached its
height, it had to come down to what we
may term the zero-point of all civilisation
from which Roman Civilisation had made
its start. But when Roman Civilisation
had reached its zenith, it was much superior
to the zenith Civilisation of Babylon, as
the zenith Babylonian was superior to the
zero-civilisation. And so also of full-fledged
Modern Civilisation. We may say that
until it returns to the common zero-point,
there is no hope of a full and perfect
development of a civilisation moulded by
spiritual ideals.</p>

<p>Let critics of Mahatma Gandhi then look
to History before they condemn him for
trying to bring this much belauded Modern
Civilisation down to the common starting
point of all great civilisations. We are at the
dawn of a New Era, and Mahatma Gandhi
is the one leader who shows to us the right
<span class="pb" id="Pgxiii">[pg xiii]</span>
path. He at least is watering the roots,
while all others who try to keep alive the
Civilisation of the Western nations are like
foolish gardeners who lavish water on the
withering leaves of a dying tree and never
think of watering its roots.</p>

<h3>BOYCOTT OF GOODS<br/>
<small><i>vs.</i></small><br/>
NON-CO-OPERATION PROGRAMME</h3>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Kasturi Ranga Aiyangar was pleased
to answer my argument in favour of the
details of the first stage of non-co-operation
that I had the honour of explaining at
the great Madras Beach meeting. He
expressed his dissent from all but the
renunciation of titles. He suggested boycott
of foreign goods in the place of the
other items. Even at the risk of repeating
arguments familiar to the readers of
"Young India", I must deal with the
question of boycott which has now received
the imprimatur of so able a publicist as
Mr.&nbsp;Kasturi Ranga Aiyangar.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg002">[pg 002]</span>In the first place, boycott of British
goods has been conceived as a punishment
and can have no place in non-co-operation
which is conceived in a spirit of self-sacrifice
and is a matter of sacred duty.</p>

<p>Secondly, any measure of punishment
must be swift, certain and adequate for the
effect intended to be produced. Resorted
to by individuals, therefore, boycott is
ineffectual, for, it can give no satisfaction
unless it is productive of effect, whereas
every act of non-co-operation is its own
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Thirdly, boycott of British goods is
thoroughly unpractical, for, it involves
sacrifice of their millions by millionaires.
It is in my opinion infinitely more difficult
for a merchant to sacrifice his millions
than for a lawyer to suspend his practice
or for a title-holder to give up his title or
for a parent to sacrifice, if need be, the
literary instruction of his children. Add
to this the important fact that merchants
have only lately begun to interest themselves
in politics. They are therefore yet
timid and cautious. But the class, to
<span class="pb" id="Pg003">[pg 003]</span>
which the first stage of non-co-operation
is intended to appeal, is the political class
which has devoted years to politics and is
not mentally unprepared for communal
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Boycott of British goods to be effective
must be taken up by the whole country at
once or not at all. It is like a siege. You
can carry out a siege only when you have
the requisite men and instruments of
destruction. One man scratching a wall
with his finger nails may hurt his fingers
but will produce no effect upon the walls.
One title-holder giving up his title has the
supreme satisfaction of having washed his
hands clean of the guilt of the donor and
is unaffected by the refusal of his fellows
to give up theirs. The motive of boycott
being punitive lacks the inherent practicability
of non-co-operation. The spirit of
punishment is a sign of weakness. A
strengthening of that spirit will retard the
process of regeneration. The spirit of
sacrifice is a determination to rid ourselves
of our weakness. It is therefore an invigorating
and purifying process and is
<span class="pb" id="Pg004">[pg 004]</span>
therefore also calculated to do good both
to us and to those who evoke the spirit of
sacrifice in us. Above all, if India has a
mission of her own, she will not fulfil
it by copying the doubtful example of the
West and making even her sacrifice
materialistically utilitarian instead of
offering a sacrifice spotless and pleasing
even in the sight of God.</p>

<hr />

<h3>KHILAFAT AND SWADESHI<span class="pb" id="Pg005">[pg 005]</span></h3>

<p>It was not without much misgiving that
I consented to include Swadeshi as a plank
in non-co-operation. But Maulana Hasrat
Mohani by his sheer earnestness bore me
down. I fear however that his reasons for
including Swadeshi are different from
mine. He is a protagonist of boycott of
British goods, I cannot reconcile myself to
the doctrine as I have explained elsewhere
in this issue. But having failed to popularise
boycott, Mohani Saheb has accepted
Swadeshi as the lesser good. It is
however necessary for me to explain how
I have come to include Swadeshi in the
programme of non-co-operation.</p>

<p>Non-co-operation is nothing but discipline
in self-sacrifice. And I believe that a
nation that is capable of limitless sacrifice
is capable of rising to limitless heights. The
purer the sacrifice the quicker the progress.
Swadeshi offers every man, woman
<span class="pb" id="Pg006">[pg 006]</span>
and child an occasion to make a beginning
in self-sacrifice of a pure type. It therefore
presents an opportunity for testing our
capacity for sacrifice. It is the measure
for gauging the depth of national feeling
on the Khilafat wrong. Does the nation
feel sufficiently to move it to go through
even the preliminary process of sacrifice?
Will the nation revise its taste for the
Japanese silk, the Manchester calico or the
French lace and find all its decoration out
of hand-spun and hand-woven cloth, i.e.,
Khadi? If crores of people will refuse to
wear or use foreign cloth and be satisfied
with the simple cloth that we can produce
in our homes, it will be proof of our organising
ability, energy, co-operation and
self-sacrifice that will enable us to secure
all we need. It will be a striking demonstration
of national solidarity.</p>

<p>Such a consummation cannot be achieved
for the mere wish. It cannot be achieved
by one man, no matter how capable and
sincere he may be. It cannot be achieved
by dotting India with Swadeshi stores. It
can only be achieved by new production
<span class="pb" id="Pg007">[pg 007]</span>
and judicious distribution. Production
means lacs of women spinning in their own
homes. This requires earnest men to be
engaged in honestly distributing carded
cotton and collecting yarn and paying for
it. It means manufacture of thousands of
spinning wheels. It means inducing the
hereditary weavers to return to their noble
calling and distributing home-spun yarn
amongst them and <ins class="corr" title="setting" id="C007">selling</ins> their manufactures.
It is thus only as an energising
agent that I can think of Swadeshi as
a plank in non-co-operation. But it is not
to be despised in that capacity. And I
hope that every worker for the cause, even
if he can do nothing else, will have done
something if he can advance Swadeshi first
by increasing production and then distribution.
He would be simply moving in a
circle if he is satisfied with distributing
cloth that is already being manufactured
in India.</p>

<hr />

<h3><span class="pb" id="Pg008">[pg 008]</span>THE SECRET OF SWARAJ</h3>

<p>The Congress resolution has rightly
emphasised the importance of Swadeshi
and the amount of greater sacrifice by
merchants.</p>

<p>India cannot be free so long as India
voluntarily encourages or tolerates the
economic drain which has been going on
for the past century and a half. Boycott
of foreign goods means no more and no less
than boycott of foreign cloth. Foreign
cloth constitutes the largest drain voluntarily
permitted by us. It means sixty
crores of rupees annually paid by us for
piece-goods. If India could make a successful
effort to stop that drain, she can gain
Swaraj by that one act.</p>

<p>India was enslaved for satisfying the
greed of the foreign cloth manufacturer.
When the East India Company came in,
we were able to manufacture all the cloth
<span class="pb" id="Pg009">[pg 009]</span>
we needed, and more for export. By processes
that need not be described here,
India has become practically wholly dependent
upon foreign manufacture for her
clothing.</p>

<p>But we ought not to be dependent. India
has the ability to manufacture all her cloth
if her children will work for it. Fortunately
India has yet enough weavers to supplement
the out-turn of her mills. The mills
do not and cannot immediately manufacture
all the cloth we want. The reader
may not know that, even at the present
moment, the weavers weave more cloth
than the mills. But the latter weave five
crore yards of fine foreign counts, equal to
forty crore yards of coarser counts. The
way to carry out a successful boycott of
foreign cloth is to increase the out-put of
yarn. And this can only be done by hand-spinning.</p>

<p>To bring about such a boycott, it is
necessary for our merchants to stop all
foreign importation, and to sell out, even at
a loss, all foreign cloth already stocked in
India, preferably to foreign buyers. They
<span class="pb" id="Pg010">[pg 010]</span>
must cease to speculate in cotton, and keep
all the cotton required for home use. They
must stop purchasing all foreign cotton.</p>

<p>The mill-owners should work their mills
not for their profits but as a national trust
and therefore cease to spin finer counts,
and weave only for the home market.</p>

<p>The householder has to revise his or her
ideas of fashion and, at least for the time
being, suspend the use of fine garments
which are not always worn to cover the
body. He should train himself to see art
and beauty in the spotlessly white <i>khaddar</i>
and to appreciate its soft unevenness. The
householder must learn to use cloth as a
miser uses his <ins class="corr" title="horde" id="C010">hoard</ins>.</p>

<p>And even when the householders have
revised their tastes about dress, somebody
will have to spin yarn for the weavers.
This can only be done by every one spinning
during spare hours either for love or
money.</p>

<p>We are engaged in a spiritual war. We
are not living in normal times. Normal
activities are always suspended in abnormal
times. And if we are out to gain
<span class="pb" id="Pg011">[pg 011]</span>
<i>Swaraj</i> in a year's time, it means that we
must concentrate upon our goal to the
exclusion of every thing else. I therefore
venture to suggest to the students all over
India to suspend their normal studies for
one year and devote their time to the
manufacture of yarn by hand-spinning. It
will be their greatest act of service to the
motherland, and their most natural contribution
to the attainment of <i>Swaraj</i>.
During the late war our rulers attempted
to turn every factory into an arsenal for
turning out bullets of lead. During this
war of ours, I suggest every national school
and college being turned into a factory for
preparing cones of yarns for the nation.
The students will lose nothing by the
occupation: they will gain a kingdom here
and hereafter. There is a famine of cloth
in India. To assist in removing this dearth
is surely an act of merit. If it is sinful to
use foreign yarn, it is a virtue to manufacture
more Swadeshi yarn in order to
enable us to cope with the want that would
be created by the disuse of foreign yarn.</p>

<p>The obvious question asked would be, if
<span class="pb" id="Pg012">[pg 012]</span>
it is so necessary to manufacture yarn,
why not pay every poor person to do so?
The answer is that hand spinning is not,
and never was, a calling like weaving,
carpentry, etc. Under the pre-British
economy of India, spinning was an honourable
and leisurely occupation for the
women of India. It is difficult to revive
the art among the women in the time at
our disposal. But it is incredibly simple and
easy for the school-goers to respond to the
nation's call. Let no one decry the work
as being derogatory to the dignity of man
or students. It was an art confined to the
women of India because the latter had
more leisure. And being graceful, musical,
and as it did not involve any great
exertion, it had become the monopoly of
women. But it is certainly as graceful for
either sex as is music for instance. In
hand-spinning is hidden the protection of
women's virtue, the insurance against
famine, and the cheapening of prices. In
it is hidden the secret of <i>Swaraj</i>. The
revival of hand spinning is the least penance
we must do for the sin of our forefathers
<span class="pb" id="Pg013">[pg 013]</span>
in having succumbed to the satanic
influences of the foreign manufacturer.</p>

<p>The school-goers will restore hand-spinning
to its respectable status. They will
hasten the process of making <i>Khaddar</i>
fashionable. For no mother, or father,
worth the name will refuse to wear cloth
made out of yarn spun by their children.
And the scholars' practical recognition of
art will compel the attention of the weavers
of India. If we are to wean the Punjabi
from the calling not of a soldier but of the
murderer of innocent and free people of
other lands, we must give back to him the
occupation of weaving. The race of the
peaceful Julahis of the Punjab is all but
extinct. It is for the scholars of the Punjab
to make it possible for the Punjabi
weaver to return to his innocent calling.</p>

<p>I hope to show in a future issue how
easy it is to introduce this change in the
schools and how quickly, on these terms,
we can nationalise our schools and colleges.
Everywhere the students have asked me
what new things I would introduce into
our nationalised schools. I have invariably
<span class="pb" id="Pg014">[pg 014]</span>
told them I would certainly introduce
spinning. I feel, so much more clearly
than ever before that during the transition
period, we must devote exclusive attention
to spinning and certain other things of
immediate national use, so as to make up
for past neglect. And the students will be
better able and equipped to enter upon the
new course of studies.</p>

<p>Do I want to put back the hand of the
clock of progress? Do I want to replace
the mills by hand-spinning and hand-weaving?
Do I want to replace the railway
by the country cart? Do I want to
destroy machinery altogether? These
questions have been asked by some journalists
and public men. My answer is: I
would not weep over the disappearance of
machinery or consider it a calamity. But
I have no design upon machinery as such.
What I want to do at the present moment
is to supplement the production of yarn and
cloth through our mills, save the millions
we send out of India, and distribute them
in our cottages. This I cannot do unless
and until the nation is prepared to devote
<span class="pb" id="Pg015">[pg 015]</span>
its leisure hours to hand-spinning. To that
end we must adopt the methods I have
ventured to suggest for popularising spinning
as a duty rather than as a means of
livelihood.</p>

<hr />

<h3>SWADESHI<span class="pb" id="Pg016">[pg 016]</span></h3>

<p>In criticising my article entitled 'The
Music of the Spinning Wheel!' the
"Leader" the other day attributed to me
the ideas that I have never entertained.
And it is necessary for the purpose of
understanding the true value of Swadeshi,
to correct some of the current fallacies.
The <i>Leader</i> considers that I am putting
back the hands of the clock of progress by
attempting to replace mill-made cloth and
mill-spun yarn by hand-woven and hand-spun
yarn. Now, I am making no such
attempt at all. I have no quarrel with the
mills. My views are incredibly simple.
India requires nearly 13 yards of cloth per
head per year. She produces, I believe,
less than half the amount. India grows all
the cotton she needs. She exports several
million bales of cotton to Japan and Lancashire
and receives much of it back in
<span class="pb" id="Pg017">[pg 017]</span>
manufactured calico although she is capable
of producing all the cloth and all the
yarn necessary for supplying her wants by
hand-weaving and hand-spinning. India
needs to supplement her main occupation,
agriculture, with some other employment.
Hand-spinning is the only such employment
for millions. It was the national
employment a century ago. It is not true
to say that economic pressure and modern
machinery destroyed hand-spinning and
hand-weaving. This great industry was
destroyed or almost destroyed by extraordinary
and immoral means adopted by
the East India Company. This national
industry is capable of being revived by
exertion and a change in the national taste
without damaging the mill industry. Increase
of mills is no present remedy for
supplying the deficiency. The difficulty
can be easily supplied only by hand-spinning
and hand-weaving. If this employment
were revived, it would prevent sixty million
rupees from being annually drained from
the country and distribute the amount
among lacs of poor women in their own
<span class="pb" id="Pg018">[pg 018]</span>
cottages. I therefore consider Swadeshi as
an automatic, though partial, solution of
the problem of India's grinding poverty. It
also constitutes a ready-made insurance
policy in times of scarcity of rain.</p>

<p>But two things are needful to bring
about the needed revival&mdash;to create a taste
for Khaddar and to provide an organisation
for the distribution of carded cotton and
collection of yarn against payment.</p>

<p>In one year, by the silent labour of a few
men, several thousand rupees have been
distributed in Gujarat among several
thousand poor women who are glad enough
to earn a few pice per day to buy milk for
their children, etc.</p>

<p>The argument does not apply to the sugar
industry as the "Leader" has attempted.
There is not sufficient cane grown in India
to supply India's wants. Sugar was never
a national and supplementary industry.
Foreign sugar has not supplanted Indian
sugar. India's wants of sugar have grown
and she therefore imports more sugar. But
this importation does not institute a drain
in the sense in which importation of
<span class="pb" id="Pg019">[pg 019]</span>
foreign cloth does. Production of more sugar
means more scientific agriculture, more
and better machinery for crushing and
refining. The sugar industry therefore
stands on a different platform. Swadeshi
in sugar is desirable, Swadeshi in cloth is
an urgent necessity.</p>

<p>The Swadeshi propaganda has been
going on in a more or less organised
manner now for the past eighteen months.
Some of its results are surprising and
gratifying. It has taken a fairly firm hold
in the Punjab, Madras and the Bombay
Presidency. Hand spinning and hand-weaving
are steadily increasing in these
parts. Several thousand rupees have been
distributed in homes where women never
did any work before. And if more work
of this kind has not been done, it is due to
want of workers.</p>

<p>This is however written more to note
the mistakes of the past than to sum up
the bright side. My observations lead me
to the conclusion that whilst the inauguration
of the three vows and Swadeshi stores
have greatly stimulated the Swadeshi
<span class="pb" id="Pg020">[pg 020]</span>
spirit, it is no longer possible to advocate
the taking of any of the three vows or the
opening of new Swadeshi stores for the
sale of mill-made cloth. The result of the
propaganda has been to send up the prices
of yarn and cloth rather than increase production.
It is clear that the purpose of
Swadeshi is not served until the quantity
of yarn and cloth produced is increased.
The gain therefore is merely moral and
not material. The people have begun to
perceive the desirability of wearing only
Swadeshi cloth if the real interest of the
country is to be advanced.</p>

<p>But it is clear that we must take practical
steps for meeting the growing demand
for Swadeshi cloth. One way, no doubt, is
to increase the mills. But it is obvious
that capitalists do not need popular
encouragement. They know that India
needs much more cloth than is manufactured
by our mills. But mills do not spring
up like mushrooms. It is a matter of
getting machinery from outside, let alone
the difficulty of getting labour. And after
all, India cannot become truly and economically
<span class="pb" id="Pg021">[pg 021]</span>
independent so long as she must
rely on the supply of machinery from
outside for the manufacture of her cloth.</p>

<p>The cleanest and the most popular form
of Swadeshi, therefore, is to stimulate
hand-spinning and hand-weaving and to
arrange for a judicious distribution of yarn
and cloth so manufactured. With a little
talent and a little industry this thing is
easy. Even as each home cooks its own
food without difficulty, so may each home
weave its own yarn. And just as in spite
of every home having its own kitchen,
restaurants continue to flourish, so will
mills continue to supply our additional
wants. But even as because of our private
kitchens we would not starve if every
restaurant was through some accident
closed, so would we, by reason of domestic
spinning, not have to be naked even if every
mill, by a blockade from the west, had to
stop work. Not long ago, we knew this
secret of our own economic independence
and it is possible for us to regain that
independence by a little effort, a little
organising agency and a little sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg022">[pg 022]</span>Therefore true Swadeshi consists in
introducing the spinning wheel in every
household and every household spinning
its own yarn. Many a Punjabi woman
does it to-day. And though we may not
supply our own cloth entirely, we shall be
saving yearly crores of rupees. In any
event there is no other Swadeshi than
increased manufacture by hand-spinning
and hand-weaving. Whether we take up
hand-spinning and hand-weaving or we do
not, it is at least necessary to understand
what true Swadeshi is.</p>

<p><i>How to kill swadeshi</i>&mdash;We are familiar
with the official ban put upon the <i>Khadi</i>
cap in various parts of India. In Bihar, I
heard that a magistrate actually sent
hawkers to sell foreign cloth. Mr.&nbsp;Painter
of Dharwar fame has gone one better, and
has issued an official circular in which he
says:</p>

<p>"All officers subordinate to the Collector
and District Magistrate are desired to
take steps to make people realise, that in
as much as India produces less than her
population requires, a boycott of foreign
<span class="pb" id="Pg023">[pg 023]</span>
cloth and its destruction or export must
inevitably lead to a serious rise in prices,
which may lead to a serious disorder and
looting, and that these consequences will
be the result, not of any action on the
part of Government but of Mr.&nbsp;Gandhi's
campaign."</p>

<p>In two other paragraphs means are
indicated of combating the Swadeshi
propaganda <i>i.e.</i> by holding meetings, and
by dealers who are opposed to boycott
attending the Collector's office at stated
hours. The Madras Government have
issued a still more pedantic circular.
The meaning of these circulars is obvious.
Pressure is to be put upon the dealers and
others not to countenance boycott. The
subordinate officials will take liberties
which the authors of circulars may not
even have contemplated. Fortunately for
the country, these threats now produce
little or no impression upon the public,
and the Swadeshi movement will go on in
the teeth of the official opposition, be it
secret or open, unscrupulous or honourable.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg024">[pg 024]</span>The officials are so ignorant and obstinate,
that they will not take the only
effective course for avoiding the feared
'disorders and looting,' <i>viz.</i> making
common cause with the public and stimulating
production. Instead of recognising
the agitation against foreign cloth as
desirable and necessary, they regard it as
an evil to be put down. And then it is
complained, that I call a system which
seeks to thwart healthy public agitation,
satanic. Why should there be any dearth of
indigenous cloth? Is there not enough
cotton in India? Are there not enough
men and women who can spin and weave?
Is it not possible to manufacture all the
required number of wheels in a few days?
Why should not each home manufacture
its own cloth, even as it cooks its own
food? Is it not enough in times of famine
to distribute uncooked grain among the
famine-striken? Why should it not be
enough to distribute raw cotton among
those who need clothing? Why this
hypocritical or false alarm about the dearth
of cloth, when it is possible in India to
<span class="pb" id="Pg025">[pg 025]</span>
manufacture enough for India's needs in a
month even without the aid of the mills?
The people have been purposely or ignorantly
kept in the dark hitherto. They have
been wrongly taught to believe, that all
the cloth needed cannot be manufactured
in India's homes as of yore. They have
been figuratively amputated and then made
to rely upon foreign or mill-made cloth. I
wish the people concerned will give the
only dignified answer possible to these
circulars. They will forthwith burn or
send out all their foreign cloth, and courageously
make up their minds to spin and
weave for their own requirements. It is
incredibly easy for every one who is not
an idler.</p>

<h3>SWADESHI IN THE PUNJAB<span class="pb" id="Pg026">[pg 026]</span></h3>

<p>The Joint Secretaries of the Bharat Stri
Maha Mandal, Punjab Branch, send a
report of the Swadeshi activities of Shrimati
Saraladevi Chaudhrani ever since her
return to Lahore from Bombay. Miss Roy
and Mrs.&nbsp;Roshandal, the Secretaries, state
that meetings of women were held respectively
on the 23rd, 24th and 25th June at
three different places in Lahore. All the
meetings were attended by hundreds of
women who were deeply interested in what
Shrimati Saraladevi had to say. The
burden of her discourses was India's deep
poverty. She traced the causes and proved
that our poverty was primarily due to the
abandonment of Swadeshi by the people.
The remedy therefore lay in reverting to
Swadeshi.</p>

<p>Saraladevi herself writes to say that her
Khaddar Sari impressed her audiences
<span class="pb" id="Pg027">[pg 027]</span>
more than her speeches, and her songs
came next, her speeches last. The good
ladies of Lahore flocked round her and <ins class="corr" title="left" id="C027">felt</ins>
her coarse but beautifully white Sari and
admired it. Some took pity on her that she
who only the other day was dressed in
costly thin silk Saris now decked herself
in hand-woven Swadeshi Khaddar. Saraladevi
wanted no pity and retorted that
their thin foreign scarves lay heavier on
their shoulders with the weight of their
helpless dependence on foreign manufacture
whereas her coarse Khaddar lay light
as a feather on her body with the joy of the
knowledge that she was free because she
wore garments in the manufacture of which
her sisters and her brothers had laboured.
This statement so pleased her audience
that most of the women present resolved
to discard foreign clothes. Saraladevi has
now been charged by these ladies to open
a shop where they could buy Swadeshi
goods. She has since addressed more
audiences. She spoke at the District Conference
at Sialkot and to a meeting exclusively
devoted to ladies numbering over
<span class="pb" id="Pg028">[pg 028]</span>
one thousand. I hope that the men of
Punjab will help Saraladevi in her self-imposed
mission. They may harness her
talents and her willingness in founding
Swadeshi Sabha and <ins class="corr" title="organasing" id="C028">organising</ins> Swadeshi
propaganda on a sound basis. Both men
and money are needed to make the work a
success.</p>

<p>Swadeshi is more than reforms. There
is much waste over reforms. There is
none in Swadeshi. Every yard of yarn spun
is so much labour well spent and so much
wealth added to the national treasury.
Every drop <ins class="corr" title="counts" id="C028a">counts.</ins> Swadeshi spells first
production and then distribution. Distribution
without production means the
raising of prices without any corresponding
benefit. For to-day demand exceeds the
supply. If we will not manufacture more
cloth, more foreign imports must continue
a painful and sinful necessity.</p>

<p>Punjab has a great opportunity. Punjab
grows splendid cotton. The art of spinning
has not yet died out. Almost every Punjabi
woman knows it. This sacred haunt of
the Rishis of old has thousands of weavers.
<span class="pb" id="Pg029">[pg 029]</span>
Only the leaders need to have faith in their
women and themselves. When Saraladevi
wrote to me that she might want goods
from Bombay, I felt hurt. The Punjab has
all the time and all the labour and the
material necessary for producing her own
cloth. She has brave merchants. She has
more than enough capital. She has brains.
Has she the will? She can organise her
own Swadeshi in less than a year, if the
leaders will work at this great cause. It
is playing with Swadeshi for the Punjab
to have to import cloth from Bombay.</p>

<p>The Punjab has to right herself by
putting her Swadeshi on a proper basis and
by ridding herself of Messrs.&nbsp;Bosworth
Smith and Company. She will then be
both economically and politically sound.
Geographically she stands at the top. She
led the way in the older times. Will she
again do so? Her men are virile to look
at. Have they virility enough to secure
without a moment's delay purity of administration?
I have not strayed from
Swadeshi to politics. My Swadeshi spirit
makes me impatient of garments that
<span class="pb" id="Pg030">[pg 030]</span>
denude India of her wealth and equally
impatient of the Smiths, the O'Briens, the
Shri Rams and the Maliks who denude her
of her self-respect and insolently touch
women's veils with their sticks, chain
innocent men as if they were beasts, or
shoot them from armoured cars or otherwise
terrorise people into subjection.</p>

<h3>SWADESHI STORES<span class="pb" id="Pg031">[pg 031]</span></h3>

<p>In a previous issue I endeavoured to
show how stores for the sake of selling
mill-manufactures did not advance Swadeshi
in any way whatsoever but on the
contrary, tended to send up the price of
cloth. I propose to show in this article
how with a small capital, it is possible to
advance true Swadeshi and earn a modest
livelihood.</p>

<p>Suppose that there is a family consisting
of husband, wife and two children one of
whom is ten years old and the other five.
If they have a capital of Rs.&nbsp;500 they can
manage a Khaddar Bhandar in a small
way. They can hire, say in a place with
a population of 20,000 inhabitants a shop
with dwelling rooms for Rs.&nbsp;10 per month.
If they sell the whole of the stock at 10&nbsp;p.c.
profit they can have Rs.&nbsp;50 per month.
They have no servants. The wife and the
<span class="pb" id="Pg032">[pg 032]</span>
children in their spare time would be
expected to help in keeping the shop tidy
and looking after it when the husband is
out. The wife and children can also devote
their spare time to spinning.</p>

<p>In the initial stages the Khaddar may
not sell at the shop. In that case the
husband is expected to hawk the Khaddar
from door to door and popularise it. He
will soon find a custom for it.</p>

<p>The reader must not be surprised at my
suggesting 10&nbsp;p.c. profits. The Khaddar
Bhandars are not designed for the poorest.
The use of Khaddar saves at least half the
cost not necessarily because the Khaddar
is more durable (though that it certainly
is) but because its use revolutionises our
tastes. I know what saving of money its
use has meant to me. Those, who buy
Khaddar from <ins class="corr" title="patroitic" id="C032">patriotic</ins> motives merely,
can easily afford to pay 10&nbsp;p.c. profits on
Khaddar. Lastly the popularising of
Khaddar means much care, devotion and
labour. And the owner of a Khaddar
Bhandar does not buy it at a wholesale
shop but he must wander to get the best
<span class="pb" id="Pg033">[pg 033]</span>
Khaddar, he must meet the local weavers
and induce them to weave hand spun yarn.
He must stimulate in his own district
hand spinning among its women. He must
come in touch with the carders and get
them to card cotton. All this means intelligence,
organisation and great ability. A
man who can exhibit these qualities has a
right to take 10&nbsp;p.c. profits. And a
Swadeshi Bhandar conducted on these
lines becomes a true centre of Swadeshi
activity. I commend my remarks to the
attention of the managers of Swadeshi
stores that are already in existence. They
may not revolutionise their method at once
but I have no doubt that they will advance
Swadeshi only to the extent that they sell
Khaddar.</p>

<h3>INDIAN ECONOMICS<span class="pb" id="Pg034">[pg 034]</span></h3>

<p>A friend has placed in my hands a bulletin
on Indian Piece Goods Trade prepared
by Mr.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Coubrough C.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;E. by order
of the Government of India. It contains
the following prefatory note: 'The Government
of India desire it to be understood
that the statements made and the views
expressed in this <ins class="corr" title="buelletin" id="C034">bulletin</ins> are those of the
author himself.' If so, why has the Government
of India burdened the tax-payer with
the expense of such bulletins? The one
before me is 16th in the series. Do they
publish both the sides of the question?</p>

<p>The bulletin under review is intended to
be an answer to the Swadeshi movement.
It is an elaborate note containing a number
of charts showing the condition of imports
and home manufacture of piece goods
including hand-woven. But it does not
assist the reader in studying the movement.
<span class="pb" id="Pg035">[pg 035]</span>
The painstaking author has bestowed no
pains upon a study of the present movement
or its scope. That the Government
of India treats the greatest constructive
and co-operative movement in the country
with supreme contempt and devotes people's
money to a vain refutation instead of a
sympathetic study and treatment is perhaps
the best condemnation that can be
pronounced upon the system under which
it is carried.</p>

<p>The author's argument is:</p>

<p>(1) The movement if successful will act
not as a protective but a prohibitive tariff.</p>

<p>(2) This must result in merely enriching
the Indian capitalist and punishing the
consumer.</p>

<p>(3) The imports are non-competitive in
that the bulk of the kind of piece goods
imported are not manufactured in India.</p>

<p>(4) The result of boycotting such piece
goods must be high prices without corresponding
benefit.</p>

<p>(5) The boycott therefore being <ins class="corr" title="aginst" id="C035">against</ins>
the law of supply and demand and against
the consumer must fail in the end.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg036">[pg 036]</span>(6) The destruction of hand spinning
which I have deplored is due to natural
causes, <i>viz.</i> the invention of time-saving
appliances and was therefore inevitable.</p>

<p>(7) The Indian farmer is responsible for
his own ruin in that he has indolently
neglected cotton culture which was once
so good.</p>

<p>(8) The best service I can render is
therefore to induce the agriculturist to
improve the quality of cotton.</p>

<p>(9) The author concludes, 'If instead of
filling homes with useless <i>Charkhas</i> he
were to start a propaganda for the more
intensive cultivation of cotton and particularly
for the production of longer staple
cotton, his influence would be felt not only
at the present day but for many generations
to come.'</p>

<p>The reader will thus see, that what I
regard as the supreme necessity for the
economical salvation of India, the author
considers to be rank folly. There is therefore
no meeting ground here. And in spite
of the prefatory note of the Government of
India reproduced by me, the <ins class="corr" title="another" id="C036">author</ins> does
<span class="pb" id="Pg037">[pg 037]</span>
represent the Government attitude. I
have invited them and the co-operators
definitely to make common cause with the
people in this movement at any rate. They
may not mind its political implications because
they do not believe in them. And
surely they need not feel sorry if contrary
to their expectation, the rise of the <i>Charkha</i>
results in an increase in the political
power of the people. Instead of waging
war against <i>Khadi</i>, they might have
popularised its use and disarmed the terrible
suspicion they labour under of wishing
to benefit the foreign manufacturer at the
expense of the Indian cultivator. My invitation
is open for all time. I prophesy
that whatever happens to the other parts
of the national programme, Swadeshi in its
present shape will bide for ever and must
if India's pauperism is to be banished.</p>

<p>Even though I am a layman, I make
bold to say that the so-called laws laid
down in books on economics are not immutable
like the laws of Medes and Persians,
nor are they universal. The economics of
England are different from those of Germany.
<span class="pb" id="Pg038">[pg 038]</span>
Germany enriched herself by bounty-fed
beet sugar. England enriched herself
by exploiting foreign markets. What was
possible for a compact area is not possible
for an area 1,900 miles long and 1,500 broad.
The economics of a nation are determined
by its climatic, geological and temperamental
conditions. The Indian conditions
are different from the English in all these
essentials. What is meat for England is
in many cases poison for India. Beef tea
in the English climate may be good, it is
poison for the hot climate of religious India.
Fiery whisky in the north of the British
Isles may be a necessity, it renders an
Indian unfit for work or society. Fur-coats
in Scotland are indispensable, they will be
an intolerable burden in India. Free trade
for a country which has become industrial,
whose population can and does live in
cities, whose people do not mind preying
upon other nations and therefore sustain
the biggest navy to protect their unnatural
commerce, may be economically sound
(though as the reader perceives, I question
its morality). Free trade for India has
<span class="pb" id="Pg039">[pg 039]</span>
proved her curse and held her in bondage.</p>

<p>And now for Mr.&nbsp;Coubrough's propositions.</p>

<p>(1) The movement is intended to serve
the purpose of a voluntary prohibitive tariff.</p>

<p>(2) But it is so conceived as neither
unduly to benefit the capitalist nor to injure
the consumer. During the very brief
transition stage the prices of home manufactures
may be, as they are, inflated. But
the rise can only be temporary as the vast
majority of consumers must become their
own manufacturers. This cottage manufacture
of yarn and cloth cannot be expensive
even as domestic cookery is not
expensive and cannot be replaced by hotel
cookery. Over twenty-five crores of the
population will be doing their own hand-spinning
and having yarn thus manufactured
woven in neighbouring localities. This
population is rooted to the soil and has
at least four months in the year to remain
idle.</p>

<p>If they spin during those hours and have
the yarn woven and wear it, no mill-made
<span class="pb" id="Pg040">[pg 040]</span>
cloth can compete with their <i>Khadi</i>. The
cloth thus manufactured will be the cheapest
possible for them. If the rest of the
population did not take part in the process,
it could easily be supplied out of the surplus
manufactured by the twenty-five
crores.</p>

<p>(3) It is true that non-competitive
imports are larger than those that compete
with the manufactures of Indian mills. In
the scheme proposed by me the question
does not arise, because the central idea is
not so much to carry on a commercial war
against foreign countries as to <ins class="corr" title="utlise" id="C040">utilise</ins> the
idle hours of the nation and thus by natural
processes to help it to get rid of her
growing pauperism.</p>

<p>(4) I have already shown that the result
of boycott cannot in the end be a rise in
the price of cloth.</p>

<p>(5) The proposed boycott is not against
the law of supply and demand, because it
does away with the law by manufacturing
enough for the supply. The movement
does require a change of taste on the part
of those who have adopted finer variety
<span class="pb" id="Pg041">[pg 041]</span>
and who patronise fantastic combinations
of colours and designs.</p>

<p>(6) I have shown in these pages, that
the destruction of hand-spinning was
designed and carried out in a most inhuman
manner by the agents of the East
India Company. No amount of appliances
would ever have displaced this national art
and industry but for this artificial and
systematically cruel manner of carrying
out the destruction.</p>

<p>(7) I am unable to hold the Indian
farmer responsible for the deterioration in
cotton culture. The whole incentive was
taken away when hand-spinning was
destroyed. The State never cared for the
cultivator.</p>

<p>(8) My activity, I am proud to think,
has already turned the cultivator's attention
to the improvement of cotton. The
artistic sense of the nation will insist on
fine counts for which long staple is a
necessity. Cotton culture by itself cannot
solve the problem of India's poverty. For
it will still leave the question of enforced
idleness untouched.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg042">[pg 042]</span>(9) I therefore claim for the <i>Charkha</i>
the honour of being able to solve the
problem of economic distress in a most
natural, simple, unexpensive and business-like
manner. The <i>Charkha</i>, therefore, is
not only not useless as the writer ignorantly
suggests, but it is a useful and indispensable
article for every home. It is the
symbol of the nation's prosperity and
therefore, freedom. It is a symbol not of
commercial war but of commercial peace.
It bears not a message of ill-will towards
the nations of the earth but of good-will
and self-help. It will not need the protection
of a navy threatening a world's peace
and exploiting its resources, but it needs
the religious determination of millions to
spin their yarn in their own homes as to-day
they cook their food in their own
homes. I may deserve the curses of
posterity for many mistakes of omission
and commission but I am confident of
earning its blessings for suggesting a
revival of the <i>Charkha</i>. I stake my all on
it. For every revolution of the wheel spins
peace, good-will and love. And with all
<span class="pb" id="Pg043">[pg 043]</span>
that, inasmuch as the loss of it brought
about India's slavery, its voluntary revival
with all its implications must mean India's
freedom.</p>

<h3>HOW TO BOYCOTT FOREIGN CLOTH<span class="pb" id="Pg044">[pg 044]</span></h3>

<p>It is <ins class="corr" title="needness" id="C044">needless</ins> to say at this time of the
day, that the proposed boycott of foreign
cloth is not a vindictive measure, but is as
necessary for national existence as breath
is for life. The quicker, therefore, it can
be brought about, the better for the country.
Without it, Swaraj cannot be established
or retained after establishment. It
is of the highest importance to know how
it can be brought about even before the
first day of August next.</p>

<p>To arrive at the boycott quickly, it is
necessary (1)&nbsp;for the mill-owners to
regulate their profits and to manufacture
principally for the Indian market, (2)&nbsp;for
importers to cease to buy foreign goods. A
beginning has already been made by three
principal merchants, (3)&nbsp;for the consumers
to refuse to buy any foreign cloth and to
buy <i>Khadi</i> wherever possible, (4)&nbsp;for the
<span class="pb" id="Pg045">[pg 045]</span>
consumers to wear only <i>Khadi</i> cloth, mill
cloth being retained for the poor who do
not know the distinction between Swadeshi
and Pardeshi, (5)&nbsp;for the consumers to
use, till Swaraj is established and <i>Khadi</i>
manufacture increased, <i>Khadi</i> just enough
for covering the body, (6)&nbsp;for the consumers
to destroy Pardeshi cloth, as they
would destroy intoxicating liquors on
taking the vow of abstinence, or to sell it
for use abroad, or to wear it out for all
dirty work or during private hours.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that all the parties
referred to in the foregoing clauses will
respond well and simultaneously. But in
the end success depends upon the persistent
determination of the consumer. He
has simply to decline to wear the badge of
his slavery.</p>

<p><i>Abusing the khaddar</i>&mdash;A friend draws
attention to the fact that many who have
adopted the <i>khaddar</i> costume are using it
as a passport for arrogance, insolence, and,
what is worse, fraud. He says that they
have neither the spirit of non-co-operation
in them nor the spirit of truth. They
<span class="pb" id="Pg046">[pg 046]</span>
simply use the <i>khaddar</i> dress as a cloak
for their deceit. All this is likely, especially
during the transition stage, i.e.,
whilst <i>khaddar</i> is beginning to become
fashionable. I would only suggest to my
correspondent that such abuse of <i>khaddar</i>
must not even unconsciously be allowed to
be used as an argument against its use.
Its use to-day is obligatory on those who
believe that there is not sufficient Indian
mill-made cloth to supply the wants of the
nation, that the wants must be supplied in
the quickest way possible by increasing
home manufacture, and that such manufacture
is possible only by making home-spinning
universal. The use of <i>khaddar</i>
represents nothing more than a most
practical recognition of the greatest economic
necessity of the country. Even a
scoundrel may recognise this necessity,
and has therefore a perfect right to wear
it. And if a Government spy wore it to
deceive people, I would welcome his use
of <i>khaddar</i> as so much economic gain to
the country. Only I would not give the
wearer of the <i>khaddar</i> more than his <ins class="corr" title="due" id="C046">due.</ins>
<span class="pb" id="Pg047">[pg 047]</span>
And I would therefore not ascribe to him
any piety or special virtue. It follows,
therefore, that co-operationists or government
servants may wear <i>khaddar</i> without
incurring the danger of being mistaken for
non-co-operationists. We may no more
shun <i>khaddar</i>, than a devout church-goer
may renounce his church because bad
characters go to it for duping gullible
people. I recall the name of an M.&nbsp;P. who
successfully cloaked many of his vices by
pretending to be a staunch temperance
man. Not very long ago a bold and
unscrupulous speculator found entry into
most respectable circles by becoming a
temperance advocate. Well has a poet
said that 'hypocricy is an ode to virtue.'</p>

<p><i>Some 'ifs'</i>&mdash;If you are a <i>weaver</i> feeling
for the country, the Khilafat and the
Punjab,</p>

<p>(1) You should weave only hand-spun
yarn, and charge so as to give you a living.
You should overcome all the difficulties of
sizing and adjusting your loom to the
requirements of coarse yarn.</p>

<p>(2) If you cannot possibly tackle hand-spun
<span class="pb" id="Pg048">[pg 048]</span>
yarn for warp, you must use Indian
mill-spun yarn for it and use hand-spun for
woof.</p>

<p>(3) Where even the second alternative
is not possible, you should use mill-spun
yarn for both warp and woof.</p>

<p>But you should henceforth cease to use
any foreign yarn, whether it is silk or
cotton.</p>

<p>If you are a <i>Congress official or worker</i>,
you should get hold of the weavers within
your jurisdiction, and place the foregoing
propositions before them for acceptance
and help them to the best of your ability.</p>

<p>If you are a <i>buyer</i>, insist upon the first
class of cloth, but if you have not the sense
or the courage to do so, take up the second
or the third, but on no account purchase
foreign cloth or cloth woven in India but
made of foreign yarn.</p>

<p>If you are a <i>householder</i>,</p>

<p>(1) You should make a fixed determination
henceforth not to buy any foreign
cloth.</p>

<p>(2) You should interview the weaver in
your neighbourhood, and get him to weave
<span class="pb" id="Pg049">[pg 049]</span>
for you enough <i>khadi</i> out of home-spun
and failing that to weave out of Indian
mill-spun yarn.</p>

<p>(3) You should deliver to the Congress
Committee all your foreign cloth for
destruction or sending to Smyrna or elsewhere
outside India.</p>

<p>(4) If you have not the courage to give
up your foreign cloth, you may wear it out
at home for all dirty work, but never go
out in foreign cloth.</p>

<p>(5) If you have any leisure, you should
devote it to learning the art of spinning
even, properly-twisted yarn for the sake of
the nation.</p>

<p>If you are a <i>schoolboy or schoolgirl</i>, you
should consider it a sin to receive literary
training, before you have spun, carded or
woven for the nation for at least four
hours per day till the establishment of
Swaraj.</p>

<h2>SPINNING<span class="pb" id="Pg051">[pg 051]</span></h2>

<hr/>

<h3>THE MUSIC OF THE SPINNING WHEEL<span class="pb" id="Pg053">[pg 053]</span></h3>

<p>Slowly but surely the music of perhaps
the most ancient machine of India is once
more permeating society. Pandit Malaviyaji
has stated that he is not going to be
satisfied until the Ranis and the Maharanis
of India spin yarn for the nation, and the
Ranas and the Maharanas sit behind the
handlooms and weave cloth for the nation.
They have the example of Aurangzeb who
made his own caps. A greater emperor&mdash;Kabir&mdash;was
himself a weaver and has immortalised
the art in his poems. The
queens of Europe, before Europe was
caught in Satan's trap, spun yarn and
considered it a noble calling. The very
words, spinster and wife, prove the ancient
dignity of the art of spinning and weaving.
'When Adam delved and Eve span, who
was then a gentleman,' also reminds one
of the same fact. Well may Panditji hope
<span class="pb" id="Pg054">[pg 054]</span>
to persuade the royalty of India to return
to the ancient calling of this sacred land
of ours. Not on the clatter of arms
depends the revival of her prosperity and
true independence. It depends most largely
upon re-introduction, in every home, of
the music of the spinning wheel. It gives
sweeter music and is more profitable than
the execrable harmonium, concertina and
the accordian.</p>

<p>Whilst Panditji is endeavouring in his
inimitably suave manner to persuade the
Indian royalty to take up the spinning
wheel, Shrimati Sarala Devi <ins class="corr" title="Choudhrani" id="C054">Chaudhrani</ins>,
who is herself a member of the Indian
nobility, has learnt the art and has thrown
herself heart and soul into the movement.
From all the accounts received from her
and others, Swadeshi has become a passion
with her. She says she feels uncomfortable
in her muslin saris and is content to
wear her <i>khaddar</i> saris even in the hot
weather. Her <i>khaddar</i> saris continue to
preach true Swadeshi more eloquently
than her tongue. She has spoken to
audiences in Amritsar, Ludhiana and
<span class="pb" id="Pg055">[pg 055]</span>
elsewhere and has succeeded in enlisting
the services, for her Spinning Committee
at Amritsar, of Mrs.&nbsp;Ratanchand and
Bugga Chowdhry and the famous Ratan
Devi who during the frightful night of the
13th April despite the Curfew Order of
General Dyer sat, all alone in the midst of
the hundreds of the dead and dying, with
her dead husband's cold head in her lap. I
venture to tender my congratulations to
these ladies. May they find solace in the
music of the spinning wheel and in the
thought that they are doing national work.
I hope that the other ladies of Amritsar
will help Sarala Devi in her efforts and
that the men of Amritsar will realise their
own duty in the matter.</p>

<p>In Bombay the readers are aware that
ladies of noted families have already taken
up spinning. Their ranks have been joined
by Dr.&nbsp;Mrs.&nbsp;Manekbai Bahudarji who has
already learnt the art and who is now trying
to introduce it in the Sevasadan. Her
Highness the Begum Saheba of Janjira
and her sister Mrs.&nbsp;Atia Begum Rahiman,
have also undertaken to learn the art. I
<span class="pb" id="Pg056">[pg 056]</span>
trust that these good ladies will, having
learnt spinning, religiously contribute to
the nation their daily quota of yarn.</p>

<p>I know that there are friends who laugh
at this attempt to revive this great art.
They remind me that in these days of mills,
sewing machines or typewriters, only a
lunatic can hope to succeed in reviving the
rusticated spinning wheel. These friends
forget that the needle has not yet given
place to the sewing machine nor has the
hand lost its cunning in spite of the typewriter.
There is not the slightest reason
why the spinning wheel may not co-exist
with the spinning mill even as the domestic
kitchen co-exists with the hotels.
Indeed typewriters and sewing machines
may go, but the needle and the reed pen
will survive. The mills may suffer destruction.
The spinning wheel is a national
necessity. I would ask sceptics to go
to the many poor homes where the spinning
wheel is again supplementing their slender
resources and ask the inmates whether the
spinning wheel has not brought joy to
their homes.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg057">[pg 057]</span>Thank God, the reward issued by Mr.&nbsp;Rewashanker
Jagjiwanagjiwan bids <ins class="corr" title="fare" id="C057">fair</ins> to bear
fruit. In a short time India will possess a
renovated spinning wheel&mdash;a wonderful
invention of a patient Deccan artisan. It
is made out of simple materials. There is
no great complication about it. It will be
cheap and capable of being easily mended.
It will give more yarn than the ordinary
wheel and is capable of being worked by a
five years old boy or girl. But whether
the new machine proves what it claims to
be or it does not, I feel convinced that
the revival of hand-spinning and hand-weaving
will make the largest contribution
to the economic and the moral regeneration
of India. The millions must have a
simple industry to supplement agriculture.
Spinning was the cottage industry years
ago and if the millions are to be saved
from starvation, they must be enabled
to reintroduce spinning in their homes,
and every village must repossess its own
weaver.</p>

<h3>"HANDLOOMS OR POWERMILLS?"<span class="pb" id="Pg058">[pg 058]</span></h3>

<p>Whenever an attempt has been made,
as it is being made to-day, to encourage
the use and production of hand-spun and
hand-woven cloth, many have looked
askance whether it is intended in this age
of mechanical industrialism to supplant
the latter by medieval handlooms. The
issue is placed between the hand power
and the power mill. A correspondent of
the <i>Janmabhumi</i> falls into this common
error. Apparently agitated at the idea of
reviving the home industries, he exclaims,
"The real question for consideration with
us or with any people to-day is not whether
the handloom will or will not be able
to hold its own against the power loom, or
whether it cannot feed millions of families
or clothe millions more in home-made
dress; but which will contribute to the
economic and political power of a nation
<span class="pb" id="Pg059">[pg 059]</span>
or country, whether it is the handloom or
the power-mill? Handicrafts or machine
industries&mdash;that is the real issue."</p>

<p>It is not quite clear from the above what
the notions of the correspondent are about
the economic and political power of this
country. We cannot imagine him to seriously
believe&mdash;though his argument runs as
if he does&mdash;that that power can be achieved
without feeding and clothing the millions
of our half-starving and half-naked men,
women and children. The political and
economic power of a nation depends even
in this "age of mechanical industrialism,"
not on its powerful machines but on its
powerful men. Germany was equipped
with the best and most powerful and
modern machinery, but it failed because at
the last moment the power of its nation
failed. We want to organise our national
power. This can be done not by adopting
the best methods of production only but
by the best method of <i>both</i> the production
and the distribution. Production that is
the manufacture of cloth in this particular
instance can be brought about in two ways;
<span class="pb" id="Pg060">[pg 060]</span>
(1)&nbsp;by establishing new mills and increasing
the output or producing capacity of
each mill and (2)&nbsp;by increasing the number
of hand-looms and improving them. All
these activities can go together. The
notion of a competition between the hand-loom
and the power mill has been shown
by such an eminent economist as Prof.&nbsp;Radha
Kamal Mukerjea to be "altogether
wrong." Says Mr.&nbsp;Mukerjea in his <i>Foundations
of Indian Economics</i>:</p>

<p>"The hand-loom does not compete with
the mill, it supplements it in the following
way:</p>

<p>(1) It produces special kinds of goods
which cannot be woven in the mills.</p>

<p>(2) It utilizes yarn below and above certain
counts which cannot at present be
used on the power-mill.</p>

<p>(3) It will consume the surplus stock of
Indian spinning mills which need not then
be sent out of the country.</p>

<p>(4) Being mainly a village-industry, it
supplies the local demand, at the same
time gives employment to small capitalists,
weavers and other village workmen and</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg061">[pg 061]</span>(5) lastly it will supply the long-felt
want of, and honest field of, work and livelihood
for educated Indians."</p>

<p>But even this is not all that can be said in
favour of hand-loom industry. Mill industry
no doubt can be a powerful aid to the
promotion of Swadeshi. But apart from
the bitter struggle, strife and demoralisation
of the capitalist and the workman (as
explained by the eminent scholar, administrator
and economist, the late Mr.&nbsp;Romesh
Chundra Dutt) it has led to, the question
is: Can it solve the problem which pure
Swadeshi is designed and sought to do and
which arises only because of its abandonment?
Every writer of note on the industries
of India, whatever his ideas and
conclusions about the future of Indian
Industrialism may be, has shown that
there was a time and that was even till the
Early British Rule in India&mdash;where spinning
and weaving, only next to agriculture,
were the great national industries of India,
when all the cotton was spun by hand and
every portion of the work was done by the
farming population which augmented its
<span class="pb" id="Pg062">[pg 062]</span>
resources by spinning and weaving. Mr.&nbsp;Dutt
has given extracts from the statistical
observations of Dr.&nbsp;Francis Buchanan's
economic enquiries in Southern and
Northern India, conducted between 1798
and 1814. They show how many hundreds
of thousands of our men, women and
children worked on this industry&mdash;mostly
in their leisure time&mdash;each day and earned
crores of rupees annually.</p>

<p>How our home-industries came to the
sad plight they are in to-day is an open
secret, admitted by all authorities and need
not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that
the problem to-day is not to bring about
that political and economic re-organisation
of our country, which disturbs the West
to-day&mdash;an organisation which has led to
the breaking up of the society by ceaseless
struggles, bitterness and rupture between
Capital and Labour. We want to work out
the real political and economic regeneration
of the country by Swadeshi. And the
problem of the Swadeshi is the problem of
80 per cent. of our population who spend
more than six months of the year in
<span class="pb" id="Pg063">[pg 063]</span>
enforced idleness, eking, throughout the
year, a miserable, half-starving and half-naked
existence. We must find out suitable
work for them during their idle hours.
We must make them a real asset and power
to the nation. Pure Swadeshi alone can
do it.</p>

<h3>HAND-SPINNING AND HAND-WEAVING<span class="pb" id="Pg064">[pg 064]</span></h3>

<p>Some people spurn the idea of making in
this age of mechanism hand-spinning and
hand-weaving a national industry, but
they forget there are millions of their
countrymen in this age who, for want of
suitable occupation, are eking out a most
miserable existence, and thousands who
die of starvation and underfeeding every
year, whereas only a hundred years ago
hand-spinning and hand-weaving proved an
insurance against a pauper's death. The
extent to which relief was provided by this
industry is recorded by Mr.&nbsp;Dutt in his
"History of India: Victorian age" from
the investigations conducted by Dr.&nbsp;Buchanan
for seven years, 1813&ndash;1820. Dr.&nbsp;Buchanan
travelled throughout of the
whole country. And his observations and
statistics convinced him that next to
<span class="pb" id="Pg065">[pg 065]</span>
agriculture, hand-spinning and hand-weaving
were the great national industries.
We make no apology for giving some of
the facts and figures collected by Dr.&nbsp;Buchanan:</p>

<p>In the districts of Patna and Behar with
a population of 3,364,420 souls, the number
of spinners was 330,426. "By far the greater
part of these," observed Dr. Buchanan,
"spin only a few hours in the afternoon,
and upon the average estimate the whole
value of the thread that each spins in a
year is worth Rs.&nbsp;7&ndash;2&ndash;8 giving a total
annual income of Rs.&nbsp;23,67,277 and by a
similar calculation the raw material at the
retail price will amount to Rs.&nbsp;12,86,272,
leaving a profit of Rs.&nbsp;10,81,005 for the
spinners or Rs.&nbsp;3&ndash;4&ndash;0 per spinner...."</p>

<p>In the district of Shahbad, spinning was
the chief industry. 159,500 women were
employed in spinning and spun yarn to the
value of Rs.&nbsp;12,50,000 a year. Deducting the
value of cotton each woman had some thing
left to her to add to the income of the
family to which she belonged.</p>

<p>In the Bhagalpur district (with a
<span class="pb" id="Pg066">[pg 066]</span>
population of 2,019,900) where all castes
were permitted to spin, 160,000 women
spent a part of their time in spinning and
each made an annual income of Rs.&nbsp;4&frac12;
after deducting the cost of cotton. This
was added to the family income. In the
Gorakhpur district (population 1,385,495)
175,600 women found employment in
spinning and made an annual income of
Rs.&nbsp;2&frac12; per head. In the Dinjapur district
(with a population of 300,000) cotton-spinning
which was the principal manufacture
occupied the leisure hours 'of all
women of higher rank and of the greater
part of the farmers' wives.' Three rupees
was the annual income each woman made
by spinning in her afternoon hours.</p>

<p>In the Purniya district (population
2,904,380) all castes considered spinning
honourable and a very large population of
women of the district did some spinning in
their leisure hours.</p>

<p>In eastern Mysore women of all castes
except Brahmans bought cotton and wool
at weekly markets, spun at home, and
sold the thread to weavers. Men and
<span class="pb" id="Pg067">[pg 067]</span>
women thus found a profitable occupation.
In Coimbatore, the wives of all the low
class cultivators were great spinners.</p>

<p>The statistics of weavers show that they
also were as numerous as the spinners. In
the Patna city and Behar district, the
total number of looms employed in the
manufacture of chaddars and table cloths
was 750, and the value of the annual
manufactures was Rs.&nbsp;5,40,000 leaving a
profit of Rs.&nbsp;81,400, deducting the value
of thread. This gave a profit of Rs.&nbsp;108
for each loom worked by three persons or
an income of Rs.&nbsp;36 a year for each person.
But the greater part of the cloth-weavers
made coarse cloth for country use to the
value of Rs.&nbsp;24,386,621 after deducting the
cost of thread. This gave a profit of Rs.&nbsp;28
for each loom.</p>

<p>In Shahabad weavers worked in cotton
only. 7,025 houses of weavers worked in
cotton and had 7,950 looms. Each loom
made an annual income of Rs.&nbsp;20&frac34; a year
and each loom required the labour of a man
and his wife as well as one boy or girl. But
as a family could not be supported for less
<span class="pb" id="Pg068">[pg 068]</span>
than Rs.&nbsp;48 a year, Dr.&nbsp;Buchanan suspected
that the income of each loom given
above was understated.</p>

<p>In the Bhagalpur district some worked
in silk alone. A great many near the town
made Tasar fabrics of silk and cotton
intermixed; 3,275 looms were so employed
that the annual profit of each weaver
employed in the mixed silk and cotton
industry was calculated to be Rs.&nbsp;46
besides what the woman made.</p>

<p>For the weaving of cotton-cloth, there
were 7,279 looms. Each loom yielded a
profit of Rs.&nbsp;20 a year. But by another
calculation, Dr.&nbsp;Buchanan estimated it to
be Rs.&nbsp;32 a year.</p>

<p>In the Gorakhpur district there were
5,434 families of weavers possessing 6,174
looms and each loom brought an income of
Rs.&nbsp;23&frac12;. Dr.&nbsp;Buchanan thought this
was too low an estimate and believed that
each loom brought an income of Rs.&nbsp;88
in the year.</p>

<p>In the Dungarpur district "Maldai"
cloth was manufactured. It consisted of
silk warp and cotton woof. 4,000 looms
<span class="pb" id="Pg069">[pg 069]</span>
were employed in this work and it was
said that each loom made Rs.&nbsp;20 worth of
cloth in a month, which Dr.&nbsp;Buchanan
considered too high an estimate. About
800 looms were employed in making larger
pieces in the form of Elachis.</p>

<p>In the Purniya district weavers were
numerous.... In Eastern Mysore cotton-weavers
made cloth for home-use as silk
weavers produced a strong rich fabric.
Workmen who made cloth with silk
borders earned As.&nbsp;6 a day and those who
made silk cloth earned As.&nbsp;<ins class="corr" title="4" id="C069">4.</ins></p>

<p>Thus we see that crores of rupees were
earned by these spinners and weavers
by following their noble and honest calling.
The decentralisation of the industry&mdash;every
village, town and district having always
at its command as much supply as it
needed&mdash;automatically facilitated its distribution
and saved the consumer from Railway
Excise and all sorts of tariffs and
middlemen's profits that he is a <ins class="corr" title="victim" id="C069a">victim to</ins>
to-day. If we cannot return to these days&mdash;though
there is no reason, except our own
bias and doubt why we should not&mdash;can we
<span class="pb" id="Pg070">[pg 070]</span>
not at least so organise our industries as
to do away without much delay with the
foreign cloth with which our markets are
being dumped to-day?</p>

<h3>HAND-SPINNING AGAIN<span class="pb" id="Pg071">[pg 071]</span></h3>

<p><i>The Servant of India</i> has a fling too at
spinning and that is based as I shall
presently show on ignorance of the facts.
Spinning does protect a woman's virtue,
because it enables women, who are to-day
working on public roads and are often in
danger of having their modesty outraged,
to protect themselves, and I know no other
occupation that lacs of women can follow
save spinning. Let me inform the jesting
writer that several women have already
returned to the sanctity of their homes
and taken to spinning which they say is
the one occupation which means so much
<i>barkat</i> (blessing). I claim for it the properties
of a musical instrument, for whilst
a hungry and a naked woman will refuse
to dance to the accompaniment of a piano,
I have seen women beaming with joy to
see the spinning wheel work, for they
<span class="pb" id="Pg072">[pg 072]</span>
know that they can through that rustic
instrument both feed and clothe themselves.</p>

<p>Yes, it does solve the problem of India's
chronic poverty and is an insurance
against famine. The writer of the jests
may not know the scandals that I know
about irrigation and relief works. These
works are largely a fraud. But if my wise
counsellors will devote themselves to
introducing the wheel in every home, I
promise that the wheel will be an almost
complete protection against famine. It is
idle to cite Austria. I admit the poverty
and limitations of my humanity. I can
only think of India's <i>Kamadhenu</i>, and the
spinning wheel is that for India. For
India had the spinning wheel in every
home before the advent of the East India
Company. India being a cotton growing
country, it must be considered a crime to
import a single yard of yarn from outside.
The figures quoted by the writer are
irrelevant.</p>

<p>The fact is that in spite of the manufacture
of <ins class="corr" title="62·7" id="C072">62.7</ins> crores pounds of yarn in 1917&ndash;18
<span class="pb" id="Pg073">[pg 073]</span>
India imported several crore yards of
foreign yarn which were woven by the
mills as well as the weavers. The writer
does not also seem to know that more
cloth is to-day woven by our weavers than
by mills, but the bulk of it is foreign yarn
and therefore our weavers are supporting
foreign spinners. I would not mind it
much if we were doing something else
instead. When spinning was almost
compulsorily stopped nothing replaced it
save slavery and idleness. Our mills
cannot to-day spin enough for our wants,
and if they did, they will not keep down
prices unless they were compelled. They
are frankly money-makers and will not
therefore regulate prices according to the
needs of the nations. Hand-spinning is
therefore designed to put millions of
rupees in the hands of poor villagers. Every
agricultural country requires a supplementary
industry to enable the peasants
to utilise the spare hours. Such industry
for India has always been spinning. Is it
such a visionary ideal&mdash;an attempt to revive
an ancient occupation whose destruction
<span class="pb" id="Pg074">[pg 074]</span>
has brought on slavery, pauperism and
disappearance of the inimitable artistic
talents which was once all expressed in the
wonderful fabric of India and which was
the envy of the world?</p>

<p>And now a few figures. One boy could,
if he worked say four hours daily, spin
&frac14;&nbsp;lb. of yarn. 64,000 students would,
therefore, spin 16,000 lbs. per day, and
therefore feed 8,000 weavers if a weaver
wove two lbs. of hand-spun yarn. But the
students and others are required to spin
during this year of purification by way of
penance in order to popularise spinning
and to add to the manufacture of hand-spun
yarn so as to overtake full manufacture
during the current year. The nation
may be too lazy to do it. But if all put their
hands to this work, it is incredibly easy,
it involves very little sacrifice and saves
an annual drain of sixty crores even if it
does nothing else. I have discussed the
matter with many mill-owners, several economists,
men of business and no one has
yet been able to challenge the position
herein set forth. I do expect the 'Servant
<span class="pb" id="Pg075">[pg 075]</span>
of India' to treat a serious subject with
seriousness and accuracy of information.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Y. I.&mdash;16th Feb. 1921.</i></p>

<hr />

<h3>A PLEA FOR SPINNING<span class="pb" id="Pg076">[pg 076]</span></h3>

<p>A determined opposition was put up
against the conditions regarding Swadeshi
that were laid down in the civil disobedience
resolution passed by the All-India Congress
Committee at Delhi. It was directed against
two requirements, namely, that the civil
resister offering resistance in terms of that
resolution was bound to know hand-spinning
and use only hand-spun and hand-woven
<i>khadi</i>; and that in the event of a
district or tahsil offering civil disobedience
<i>en masse</i> the district or the tahsil concerned
must manufacture its own yarn and cloth
by the hand. The opposition betrayed woeful
ignorance of the importance of hand-spinning.
Nothing but hand-spinning can
banish pauperism from the land. Paupers
cannot become willing sufferers. They
have never known the pain of plenty to
appreciate the happiness of voluntarily
<span class="pb" id="Pg077">[pg 077]</span>
suffering hunger or other bodily discomfort.
Swaraj for them can only mean
ability to support themselves without begging.
To awaken among them a feeling
of discontent with their lot without providing
them with the means of removing the
cause thereof is to court certain destruction,
anarchy, outrage and plunder in which
they themselves will be the chief victims.
Hand-spinning alone can possibly supply
them with supplementary and additional
earnings. Hand-weaving for many and
carding for a limited number can provide
complete livelihood. But hand-weaving is
not a lost art. Several million men know
hand-weaving. But very few know hand-spinning
in the true sense of the term. Tens
of thousands are, it is true, turning the
wheel to-day but only a few are spinning
yarn. The cry all over is that hand-spun
yarn is not good enough for warp. Just as
half-baked bread is no bread, even so ill-spun
weak thread is no yarn. Thousands
of men must know hand-spinning to be able
in their respective districts to improve the
quality of the yarn that is now being spun
<span class="pb" id="Pg078">[pg 078]</span>
in the country. Therefore those who offer
civil disobedience for the sake of establishing
Swaraj must know hand-spinning.
Mark, they are not required to turn out
yarn every day. It would be well if they
did. But they must know how to spin even
properly twisted yarn. It was a happy
omen to me, that in spite of the opposition
the amendment was rejected by a large
majority. One argument advanced in favour
of rejection was, that the Sikh men
considered it an undignified occupation to
spin and looked down upon hand-weaving.
I do hope that the sentiment is not representative
of the brave community. Any
community that despises occupations that
bring an honest livelihood is a community
going down an incline. If spinning has been
the speciality of women, it is because they
have more leisure and not because it is an
inferior occupation. The underlying suggestion
that a wielder of the sword will not
wield the wheel is to take a distorted view
of a soldier's calling. A man who lives by
the sword does <i>not</i> serve his community
even as the soldiers in the employ of the
<span class="pb" id="Pg079">[pg 079]</span>
Government do not serve the country. The
wielding of the sword is an unnatural
occupation resorted to among civilized
people only on extraordinary occasions
and only for self-defence. To live by hand-spinning
and hand-weaving is any day
more <i>manly</i> than to live by killing. Aurangzeb
was not the less a soldier for sewing
caps. What we prize in the Sikhs is not
their ability to kill. The late Sardar Lachman
Singh will go down to posterity as a
hero, because he knew how to die. The
Mahant of Nankhana Saheb will go down
to posterity as a murderer. I hope therefore
that no man will decline to learn the
beautiful life-giving art of hand-spinning
on the ground of its supposed inferiority.</p>

<h3>THE DUTY OF SPINNING<span class="pb" id="Pg080">[pg 080]</span></h3>

<p>In "The Secret of Swaraj" I have endeavoured
to show what home spinning means
for our country. In any curriculum of the
future, spinning must be a compulsory
subject. Just as we cannot live without
breathing and without eating, so is it impossible
for us to attain economic independence
and banish pauperism from this
ancient land without reviving home-spinning.
I hold the spinning wheel to be as
much a necessity in every household as
the hearth. No other scheme that can be
devised will ever solve the problem of the
deepening poverty of the people.</p>

<p>How then can spinning be introduced in
every home? I have already suggested the
introduction of spinning and systematic
production of yarn in every national school.
Once our boys and girls have learnt the
art they can easily carry it to their homes.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg081">[pg 081]</span>But this requires organisation. A spinning
wheel must be worked for twelve
hours per day. A practised spinner can spin
two tolas and a half per hour. The price
that is being paid at present is on an
average four annas per forty tolas or one
pound of yarn <i>i.e.</i>, one pice per hour. Each
wheel therefore should give three annas
per day. A strong one costs seven rupees.
Working, therefore, at the rate of twelve
hours per day it can pay for itself in less
than 38 days. I have given enough figures
to work upon. Any one working at them
will find the results to be startling.</p>

<p>If every school introduced spinning, it
would revolutionize our ideas of financing
education. We can work a school for six
hours per day and give free education to
the pupils. Supposing a boy works at the
wheel for four hours daily, he will produce
every day 10 tolas of yarn and thus earn
for his school one anna per day. Suppose
further that he <ins class="corr" title="maufactures" id="C081">manufactures</ins> very little
during the first month, and that the school
works only twenty six days in the month.
He can earn after the first month Rs.&nbsp;1&ndash;10
<span class="pb" id="Pg082">[pg 082]</span>
per month. A class of thirty boys would
yield, after the first month, an income of
Rs.&nbsp;48&ndash;12 per month.</p>

<p>I have said nothing about literary <ins class="corr" title="trainning" id="C082">training</ins>.
It can be given during the two hours
out of the six. It is easy to see that every
school can be made self supporting without
much effort and the nation can engage
experienced teachers for its schools.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in working out the
scheme is the spinning wheel. We require
thousands of wheels if the art becomes
popular. Fortunately, every village carpenter
can easily construct the machine. It is
a serious mistake to order them from the
Ashram or any other place. The beauty of
spinning is that it is incredibly simple,
easily learnt, and can be cheaply introduced
in every village.</p>

<p>The course suggested by me is intended
only for this year of purification and probation.
When normal times are reached
and Swaraj is established one hour only
may be given to spinning and the rest to
literary training.</p>

<h3>THE DUTY OF SPINNING<span class="pb" id="Pg083">[pg 083]</span></h3>

<p>[Speaking at a monster meeting of
students held in Mirzapur Park, Calcutta,
Mahatma Gandhi appealed to them to
withdraw from educational institutions.
In the course of that speech he spoke on
the duty of spinning, which portion is
printed here.]</p>

<p>Our education has been the most deficient
in two things. Those who framed
our education code neglected the training
of the body and the soul. You are receiving
the education of the soul but the very
fact of non-co-operation for non-co-operation
is nothing less and nothing more than
withdrawing from participation in the evil
that this Government is doing and continuing
to do. And if we are withdrawing
from evil conscientiously, deliberately, it
means that we are walking with our face
towards God. That completes or begins
<span class="pb" id="Pg084">[pg 084]</span>
the soul training. But seeing that our
bodily education has been neglected, and
seeing that India has become enslaved
because India forgot the spinning wheel,
and because India sold herself for a mess
of pottage, I am not afraid to place before
you, the young men of Bengal, the spinning
wheel for adoption. And let a training in
spinning and production of as much yarn
as you can ever do constitute your main
purpose and your main training during this
year of probation. Let your ordinary
education commence after Swaraj is established,
but let every young man, and every
girl, of Bengal consider it to be their sacred
duty to devote all their time and energy to
spinning. I have drawn attention to the
parallel, that presents itself before us, from
the war.</p>

<h3>THE DOCTRINE OF CHARKA<span class="pb" id="Pg085">[pg 085]</span></h3>

<p>[The opening session of the National
College, Calcutta, under the auspices of
the Board of Education, formed by Srijuts
Chittaranjan Das, Jitendralal Banerjee and
other non-co-operation leaders, took place
on Friday the 4th February 1921. In
opening this College, Mahatma Gandhi
addressed the students and professors,
from which the following is culled.]</p>

<p>We have sufficiently talked about Charka
and how it is going to free India&mdash;how a
nation that came through the Charka to
this country as traders, merchants and
travellers settled themselves down as rulers
with our co-operation, and how non-co-operation
and by means of that very Indian
<i>Charka</i> they will go back to their own
country if they cannot live as fellow-citizens
in India.</p>

<p>There are peoples who say&mdash;"how can
<span class="pb" id="Pg086">[pg 086]</span>
you expect the Mahomedans to be non-violent."
How, I do not want to speak out.
I want the <i>Charka</i> itself to speak out. The
whole Europe will know when we place
these Charkas in our mosques. Something
like 800 Charkas had been ordered for the
mosques so that the people who come there
should be able to produce Indian yarn with
which Indian clothes should be woven by
Indian hands in Indian homes to clothe
our nakedness or at least to provide home-spun
shrouds for us. Thus every revolution
of the <i>Charka</i> I can assure you, will
bring the success of this bloodless revolution
the nearer every day. That is the
doctrine of <i>Charka</i>. Therefore I ask you
to work up this doctrine which will be a
great advertisement both of our determination
to win freedom, and if possible, through
peaceful means.</p>

<p>If you are determined to have the freedom
of your country, if you want to see
the cessation of our slavery in which we
are living for close upon two centuries, it
requires from you a peaceful battle&mdash;the
battle of the <i>Charka</i>.</p>

<h3>THE MESSAGE OF THE CHARKA<span class="pb" id="Pg087">[pg 087]</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Indian Social Reformer</i> has published
a note from a correspondent in praise of
the spinning-wheel. The correspondent in
the course of his remarks hopes, that the
movement will be so organised that the
spinners may not weary of it. <ins class="corr" title="Mr," id="C087">Mr.</ins>&nbsp;Amritlal
Thakkar in his valuable note (published in
the <i>Servant of India</i>) on the experiment
which he is conducting in Kathiawad, says
that the charkha has been taken up by
the peasant women. They are not likely
to weary, for to them it is a source of
livelihood to which they were used before.
It had dried up, because there was no
demand for their yarn. Townspeople who
have taken to spinning may weary, if they
have done so as a craze or a fashion. Those
only will be faithful, who consider it their
duty to devote their spare hours to doing
what is to-day the most useful work for
<span class="pb" id="Pg088">[pg 088]</span>
the country. The third class of spinners
are the school-going children. I expect
the greatest results from the experiment
of introducing the charkha in the National
Schools. If it is conducted on scientific
lines by teachers who believe in the charkha
as the most efficient means of making
education available to the seven and a half
lacs of villages in India, there is not only
no danger of weariness, but every prospect
of the nation being able to solve the problem
of financing mass education without
any extra taxation and without having to
fall back upon immoral sources of revenue.</p>

<p>The writer in the <i>Indian Social Reformer</i>
suggests, that an attempt should be made
to produce finer counts on the spinning-wheel.
I may assure him that the process
has already begun, but it will be some time
before we arrive at the finish of the Dacca
muslin or even twenty counts. Seeing
that hand-spinning was only revived last
September, and India began to believe in
it somewhat only in December, the progress
it has made may be regarded as
phenomenal.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg089">[pg 089]</span>The writer's complaint that hand-spun
yarn is not being woven as fast as it is
spun, is partly true. But the remedy is
not so much to increase the number of
looms, as to persuade the existing weavers
to use hand-spun yarn. Weaving is a
much more complex process than spinning.
It is not, like spinning, only a supplementary
industry, but a complete means of
livelihood. It therefore never died out.
There are <i>enough weavers and enough
looms in India to replace the whole of the
foreign import of cloth</i>. It should be
understood that our looms&mdash;thousands of
them in Madras, Maharashtra and Bengal&mdash;are
engaged in weaving the fine yarn
imported from Japan and Manchester.
We <i>must</i> utilize these for weaving hand-spun
yarn. And for that purpose, the
nation has to revise its taste for the thin
tawdry and useless muslins. I see no art
in weaving muslins, that do not cover but
only expose the body. Our ideas of art
must undergo a change. But even if the
universal weaving of thin fabric be considered
desirable in normal conditions, at
<span class="pb" id="Pg090">[pg 090]</span>
the present moment whilst we are making a
mighty effort to become free and self-supporting,
we must be content to wear the
cloth that our hand-spun yarn may yield.
We have therefore to ask the fashionable
on the one hand to be satisfied with
coarser garments; we must educate the
spinners on the other hand to spin finer
and more even yarn.</p>

<p>The writer pleads for a reduction in the
prices charged by mill-owners for their
manufactures. When lovers of Swadeshi
begin to consider it their duty to wear
khaddar, when the required number of
spinning-wheels are working and the
weavers are weaving hand-spun yarn, the
mill-owners will be bound to reduce prices.
It seems almost hopeless merely to appeal
to the patriotism of those whose chief aim
is to increase their own profits.</p>

<p>Incongruities pointed out by the writer
such as the wearing of khaddar on public
occasions and at other times of the
most fashionable English suits, and the
smoking of most expensive cigars by
wearers of khaddar, must disappear in
<span class="pb" id="Pg091">[pg 091]</span>
course of time, as the new fashion gains
strength. It is my claim that as soon as
we have completed the boycott of foreign
cloth, we shall have evolved so far that we
shall necessarily give up the present absurdities
and remodel national life in keeping
with the ideal of simplicity and domesticity
implanted in the bosom of the
masses. We will not then be dragged
into an imperialism, which is built upon
exploitation of the weaker races of the
earth, and the acceptance of a giddy
materialistic civilization protected by
naval and air forces that have made peaceful
living almost impossible. On the
contrary, we shall then refine that imperialism,
into a common wealth of nations
which will combine, if they do, for the
purpose of giving their best to the world
and of protecting, not by brute force but
by self-suffering, the weaker nations or
races of the earth. Non-co-operation aims
at nothing less than this revolution in the
thought-world. Such a transformation can
come only after the complete success of
the spinning-wheel. India can become fit
<span class="pb" id="Pg092">[pg 092]</span>
for delivering such a message, when she
has become proof against temptation and
therefore attacks from outside, by becoming
self-contained regarding two of
her chief needs&mdash;food and clothing.</p>

<h3>THE CHARKA IN THE GITA<span class="pb" id="Pg093">[pg 093]</span></h3>

<p>In the last issue I have endeavoured to
answer the objections raised by the Poet
against spinning as a sacrament to be
performed by all. I have done so in all
humility and with the desire to convince
the Poet and those who think like him.
The reader will be interested in knowing,
that my belief is derived largely from the
Bhagavadgita. I have quoted the relevant
verses in the article itself. I give below
Edwin Arnold's rendering of the verses
from his Song Celestial for the benefit of
those who do not read Sanskrit.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Work is more excellent than idleness;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The body's life proceeds not, lacking work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a task of holiness to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faithful soul; such earthly duty do<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><span class="pb" id="Pg094">[pg 094]</span>Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the beginning, when all men were made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with mankind, the sacrifice&mdash;"Do this!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Work! Sacrifice! Increase and multiply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sacrifice! This shall be Kamadhuk,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your 'Cow of Plenty', giving back her milk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gods shall yield ye grace. Those meats ye crave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who eat of food after their sacrifice<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pb" id="Pg095">[pg 095]</span>All for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By food the living live; food comes of rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rain comes by the pious sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus action is of Brahma, who is one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Only, All&mdash;pervading; at all times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Present in sacrifice. He that abstains<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To help the rolling wheels of this great world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shameful and vain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Work here undoubtedly refers to physical
labour, and work by way of sacrifice can
only be work to be done by all for the
common benefit. Such work&mdash;such sacrifice
can only be spinning. I do not wish to
suggest, that the author of the Divine Song
had the spinning wheel in mind. He merely
laid down a fundamental principle of
conduct. And reading in and applying it to
India I can only think of spinning as the
fittest and most acceptable sacrificial body
labour. I cannot imagine anything nobler
or more national than that for say one hour
<span class="pb" id="Pg096">[pg 096]</span>
in the day we should all do the labour that
the poor must do, and thus identify ourselves
with them and through them with all
mankind. I cannot imagine better worship
of God than that in His name I should
labour for the poor even as they do. The
spinning wheel spells a more equitable
distribution of the riches of the earth.</p>

<h3>SPINNING AS FAMINE RELIEF<span class="pb" id="Pg097">[pg 097]</span></h3>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Jaiji Petit has sent the following
notes of an experiment being conducted in
spinning among the famine-stricken people
at Miri near Ahmednagar. I gladly publish
the notes as the experiment is being
conducted under the supervision of an
Englishwoman. The reader will not fail
to observe the methodical manner in which
the work is being done. All the difficulties
have been met and provided for. Even
the very small experiment shows what a
potent <ins class="corr" title="instrument," id="C097">instrument</ins> the spinning wheel is
for famine relief. Properly organised it
cannot but yield startling results.&mdash;M.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;G.</p>

<p>In the month of August 1920, when the
severity of the famine was being felt, the
idea of introducing spinning as a famine
relief to respectable middle class people
was started and Miss Latham kindly gave
<span class="pb" id="Pg098">[pg 098]</span>
a spinning wheel to introduce the work.
Attempts were made to introduce the work
especially among the Dhangars who were
used to spinning wool but they proved
futile. Spinning a thin thread of cotton
was thought an impossibility in a village
which did not know anything about it.
Doubts were also entertained as to whether
the work if taken up would be paying
or at least helpful. In such different
difficulties and objections, the wheel remained
idle for nearly three months, and
in spite of vigorous efforts no body seemed
willing to take up the work. In December
1920, Miss Latham again sent four more
wheels through the kindness of Mrs.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Petit
and some cotton. They were given
for trial to different persons. Signs now
seemed a little hopeful and at last one
Ramoshi woman was prevailed upon to
take up the work seriously. This was about
the 20th of January 1921, since when the
work has assumed a different shape. The
example of this woman was copied by two
more who undertook to take the work.
Through great perseverance 4 lbs. of yarn
<span class="pb" id="Pg099">[pg 099]</span>
were prepared by these three spinners and
it was sent for sale. In the meantime
many women began to make the inquiries
and expressed a desire to take it up if it
helped them financially in some way. A
rate of spinning 6&nbsp;as. a lb. was therefore
fixed and it helped other spinners to join
the work.</p>

<p>Here another difficulty viz. that of funds
came in the way. All the five wheels were
engaged and five more prepared locally
were also engaged. The stock of cotton
was also exhausted. It seemed that the
work would suffer for want of funds to
prepare wheels, purchase cotton, and pay
the workers. Rao Bahadur Chitale personally
saw this difficulty and helped the
work with a grant of Rs.&nbsp;100. Miss
Latham, when she knew of this difficulty,
kindly sent another hundred. These two
grants came at the right time and gave a
stimulus to the work. Local gentlemen
helped with their own cotton.</p>

<p>The demand for wheels went on increasing
day by day. People being too poor to
pay for the wheels, it became necessary to
<span class="pb" id="Pg100">[pg 100]</span>
get the wheels prepared locally and lend
them to the workers. Twenty seven more
wheels were prepared which also gave
work to local carpenters who had no work
on account of famine. One carpenter
improved the wheel by making it more
light and useful for finer yarn. The prices
of the wheel were paid at Rs.&nbsp;3, Rs.&nbsp;3&ndash;8, and
Rs.&nbsp;4 per wheel according to the quality.
Three of these wheels have been sold for
Rs.&nbsp;9&ndash;8. The total sum spent on these
wheels is Rs.&nbsp;103&ndash;8&ndash;0 which includes the
sum for the wheels kindly sent by Mrs.&nbsp;Petit.</p>

<p>Though local cotton was secured for the
work, it proved too bad for beginners. A
new method therefore was introduced to
improve the local cotton, which not only
helped the work but also provided work for
a few more persons. Raw cotton was
secured and the dirt and the dry leaves in
it were carefully removed before it was
ginned. The rate for this work was fixed
at one pice per lb. Any old man who did
this work got an opportunity of earning
one anna a day, by cleaning 4&nbsp;lbs. of raw
<span class="pb" id="Pg101">[pg 101]</span>
cotton. After it was thus cleaned, it was
ginned with a hand-gin which gave work to
some women who ginned, at the rate of one
anna per 10&nbsp;lbs. One woman could thus earn
2&nbsp;as. and 6&nbsp;pies each day. This ginned
cotton was then cleaned by a <i>pinjari</i> who
charged at the rate of one anna per pound
and earned about 8&nbsp;as. per day. It would
have been better and easier too, if cotton
had been purchased from the mills, but as
this cleaning process of the local cotton
provided work for a few workers, it was
thought the more desirable in these days.
A major portion of these cleaning charges
is however made up by the sale of cotton
seed secured after ginning. The following
statement will show the expenses incurred
for this and the price of raw cotton for
every 60&nbsp;lbs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="statement of expenses">
<tr><td></td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Rs.</span>&nbsp;<span class="smcap">a.</span>&nbsp;<span class="smcap">p.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Price of 60&nbsp;lbs. of raw cotton @ 20&nbsp;Rs. a patia (240&nbsp;lbs.).</td><td align="right">5&mdash;0&mdash;0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Removal of dirt, waste and dry leaves @ 1&nbsp;pice per pound</td><td align="right">0&ndash;15&mdash;0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ginning of 52 lbs. of raw clean cotton @ 1&nbsp;an. per 10&nbsp;lbs.</td><td align="right">0&mdash;5&mdash;3</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="pb" id="Pg102">[pg 102]</span>Cleaning the Lint (17&nbsp;lbs.) by a pinjari @ 1&nbsp;Anna per lb.</td><td align="right" class="bb">1&mdash;1&mdash;0</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Total</td><td align="right">7&mdash;4&mdash;3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deduct price of cotton seed 35&nbsp;lbs. @ 20&nbsp;lbs. per Re.</td><td align="right" class="bb">1&ndash;12&mdash;0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Net charges for 17&nbsp;lbs. of clean cotton</td><td align="right">5&mdash;9&mdash;3</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Thus the cost of one pound of cotton
comes to 5&nbsp;as. and 3 pies only. The proportion
of waste viz. 8&nbsp;lbs. in 60&nbsp;lbs. of raw
cotton is too high and could be avoided by
securing better and cleaner cotton.</p>

<p>There are at present 29 wheels going and
there is still a great demand for wheels.
But the funds being limited, more wheels
could not be prepared and provided. Spinning
is done by those who absolutely <ins class="corr" title="know" id="C102">knew</ins>
nothing about it previously. Consequently
the yarn is still of an inferior sort. It is
improving day by day but if a competent
teacher could be secured, it would improve
rapidly. Amongst the spinners, some are
full-time workers and others are leisure-time
workers.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg103">[pg 103]</span>About two lbs. of yarn are now prepared
every day and the quantity will increase
as the spinners get used to the work. The
rate for spinning is fixed at 6&nbsp;as. a lb.,
though many workers complain that it is
not enough. As the yarn sent for sale
realised a price of As.&nbsp;12 a pound, the
spinning charges could not be increased
without a loss. Every lb. of yarn requires
Annas 11 pies 3 for expenses, as 0&ndash;5&ndash;3
for cotton and 0&ndash;6&ndash;0 for spinning. Thus
every lb. leaves a profit of 9 pies only. The
establishment and other charges are not
calculated. With the present rate of spinning
at 6&nbsp;as. a lb., one spinner earns 3&nbsp;as.
per day by spinning 20 to 24 tolas, more
earn 2&nbsp;as. a day by spinning 15 tolas and
the rest 1&frac12;&nbsp;as. a day for 10 tolas, the beginners
excluded. The more the spinner is
used to the work, the more he will earn.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to prepare cloth
out of the yarn and three and a half lbs. of
yarn were given to a weaver for weaving.
He however charged an exorbitant rate for
weaving. He prepared nine and a half
yards of cloth and charged Rs.&nbsp;3&ndash;9 for <ins class="corr" title="it" id="C103">it,</ins>
<span class="pb" id="Pg104">[pg 104]</span>
practically 1 rupee a lb. The cloth cost
Rs.&nbsp;6&ndash;0&ndash;6 and was sold at Rs.&nbsp;6&ndash;3&ndash;0, with a
profit of as.&nbsp;2 and pies 6 only. To obviate
the difficulty about weaving, a separate
<ins class="corr" title="room" id="C104">loom</ins> with one teacher to teach weaving to
local persons is urgently required. Many
local people wish to learn this art. A separate
loom will reduce the cost of the cloth
prepared on it below the prevailing market
rate. About 6&nbsp;lbs. of yarn are given to
different weavers to ascertain the exact
charges, but all this difficulty can only be
removed by having a special loom.</p>

<p>When there was a shortage of cotton
and the workers had no work, wool was
introduced for spinning till cotton was
ready. This work was willingly taken up
by the Dhangar. They were however required
to spin finer thread of wool than
they usually prepared. They took some
time to pick up the work, and now there
are 10 wool spinners working fine thread.
They are also paid at 6&nbsp;as. a lb. for spinning.
Wool worth Rs.&nbsp;31 @ 2&nbsp;lbs. a rupee
was purchased, and though the cotton was
ready, the wool spinning was continued
<span class="pb" id="Pg105">[pg 105]</span>
by starting a separate department, as the
Dhangars readily took up the work. The
whole process of cleaning the wool is also
done by the Dhangar women, who get an
extra anna per lb. for it. The sorting of
wool is carefully looked to. The majority
of wool spinners use their own spinning
wheels but a few are now asking for the
improved wheel for preparing finer threads.</p>

<p>Dhangar weavers being locally available
blankets after the Pandharpur and Dawangiri
pattern are being prepared from this
finer thread and different designs have been
suggested to them. The Dhangars being a
stubborn race do not readily adopt the new
improvement. But this work has set them
to work up new designs of blankets which
will permanently help them in their own
profession. They now require a broader
and improved loom and instruction in
colouring wool. Efforts are made to secure
a clever full time weaver who will introduce
a better method of weaving. Two
blankets were prepared and sold at cost
price, one for Rs.&nbsp;5&ndash;13&ndash;6 and the other for
Rs.&nbsp;6&ndash;6&ndash;0. Orders are being received for
<span class="pb" id="Pg106">[pg 106]</span>
blankets now, but to continue the work
would require some funds.</p>

<p>To keep so many persons working is not
only an ideal form of famine relief, but a
means to promote village industries, and
remove the demoralising effects of successive
famines. Thus stands the work of
about one month. It now requires an improved
handloom, a good teacher, a special
loom for wool, more spinning wheels
(which the neighbouring villagers are also
demanding) and many other things. The
work is going on vigorously and it is
hoped will not be allowed to suffer for want
of funds.</p>

<h3>THE POTENCY OF THE SPINNING-WHEEL<span class="pb" id="Pg107">[pg 107]</span></h3>

<p>No amount of human ingenuity can
manage to distribute water over the whole
land, as a shower of rain can. No irrigation
department, no rules of precedence, no
inspection and no water-cess. Every
thing is done with an ease and a gentleness
that by their very perfection evade notice.
The spinning-wheel, too, has got the same
power of distributing work and wealth in
millions of houses in the simplest way
imaginable. Those of us who do not know
what it is to earn a livelihood by the sweat
of one's brow, may consider the three
annas a day as a pittance beneath the
consideration of any man. They do not
know that even in these days of high
prices, there are districts in India where
even three annas a day would be a boon to
the poor. But we must not consider the
<span class="pb" id="Pg108">[pg 108]</span>
question of the spinning-wheel merely
from the point of individual earnings. The
spinning-wheel is a force in national regeneration.
If we wish for real Swaraj,
we must achieve economic independence.
Boycott of foreign cloth is its negative
aspect. For this we must produce cloth
sufficient to clothe the country. This can
only be done by hand-spinning. All the
mills that we have got, will not be able
together to cope with the situation. If all
rush for the thin mill-made cloth, it will
rise in price beyond the capacity of the
poor, and the experience of 1907&ndash;08 will be
repeated. Moreover, the cloth best suited
for the three seasons of India is <i>Khadi</i>.
Those who have used <i>Khadi</i> during this
summer, have come to realise, that after
the soft clean touch of <i>Khadi</i> it is impossible
to use sticky Malmal or twills.
<i>Khadi</i> can enable its wearer to withstand
the cold of an average winter as even wool
cannot. The climate of India demands
that clothes be washed as often as possible.
Only <i>Khadi</i> can stand this constant
wash. <i>Khadi</i> was once the dress of the
<span class="pb" id="Pg109">[pg 109]</span>
nation at large. One must see to believe
how venerable the old Patels and Deshmukhs
looked when dressed in home-spun
<i>Khadi</i>. There are instances of whole
villages taking a legitimate pride in the
fact that they had to import nothing but
salt in the whole round of the six seasons.
With such conditions, there could be no
drain, no exploitation and therefore no
Para-raj. A little village could make
terms with the rulers of the land consistent
with its self-respect, dignity and independence.
Is our love of luxury so inveterate,
that we cannot control it even for the sake
of Swaraj?</p>

<h3>THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE<span class="pb" id="Pg110">[pg 110]</span></h3>

<p>[A certain correspondent from Sindh
writing to Mahatma Gandhi puts the
question, "Will the spinning wheel solve
the problem of India's poverty? If it
will, how?" Here is his answer.]</p>

<p>I am more than ever convinced that
without the spinning wheel the problem of
India's poverty cannot be solved. Millions
of India's peasants starve for want of
supplementary occupation. If they have
spinning to add to their slender resources,
they can fight successfully against pauperism
and famine. Mills cannot solve the
problem. Only hand-spinning&mdash;and nothing
else&mdash;can. When India was forced to give
up hand-spinning, she had no other occupation
in return. Imagine what would happen
to a man who found himself suddenly
deprived of a quarter of his bare livelihood.
Over eighty-five percent of Her population
<span class="pb" id="Pg111">[pg 111]</span>
have more than a quarter of their time
lying idle. And, therefore, even apart
from the terrible drain rightly pointed out
by the Grand Old Man of India, she has
steadily grown poorer because of this
enforced idleness. The problem is how to
utilise these billions of hours of the nation
without disturbing the rest. Restoration
of the spinning wheel is the only possible
answer. This has nothing to do with my
special views on machinery or with the
boycott of foreign goods in general, India
is likely to accept the answer in full
during this year. It is madness to tinker
with the problem. I am writing this in
Puri in front of the murmuring waves.
The picture of the crowd of men, women,
and children, with their fleshless ribs under
the very shadow of Jagannath, haunts me.
If I had the power, I would suspend every
other activity in schools, and colleges, and
everywhere else, and popularise spinning;
prepare out of these lads and lasses
spinning teachers: inspire every carpenter
to prepare spinning wheels; and ask the
teachers to take these life-going machines
<span class="pb" id="Pg112">[pg 112]</span>
to every home, and teach them spinning.
If I had the power, I would stop an ounce
of cotton from being exported and would
have it turned into yarn in these homes. I
would dot India with depots for receiving
this yarn and distributing it among weavers.
Given sufficient steady and trained
workers, I would undertake to drive
pauperism out of India during this year.
This undoubtedly requires a change in the
angle of vision and in the national taste.
I regard the Reforms and everything else
in the nature of opiates to deaden our conscience.
We must refuse to wait for generations
to furnish us with a patient solution
of a problem which is ever-growing in
seriousness. Nature knows no mercy in
dealing stern justice. If we do not wake
up before long, we shall be wiped out of
existence. I invite the sceptics to visit
Orissa, penetrate its villages, and find out
for themselves where India stands. They
will then believe with me that to possess,
or to wear, an ounce of foreign cloth is a
crime against India and humanity. I am
able to restrain myself from committing
<span class="pb" id="Pg113">[pg 113]</span>
suicide by starvation, only because I have
faith in India's awakening, and her ability
to put herself on the way to freedom from
this desolating pauperism. Without faith
in such a possibility, I should cease to
take interest in living. I invite the
questioner, and every other intelligent
lover of his country, to take part in this
privileged national service in making spinning
universal by introducing it in every
home, and make it profitable for the nation
by helping to bring about a complete
boycott of foreign cloth during this year.
I have finished the questions and endeavoured
to answer them. The most important
from the practical stand-point was the
one regarding spinning. I hope, I have
demonstrated the necessity of home-spinning
as the only means of dealing with
India's poverty. I know, however, that
innumerable difficulties face a worker in
putting the doctrine into execution. The
most difficult, perhaps, is that of getting a
proper wheel. Save in the Punjab where
the art is still alive, the difficulty is very
real. The carpenters have forgotten the
<span class="pb" id="Pg114">[pg 114]</span>
construction and the innocent workers are
at their wit's end. The chief thing undoubtedly,
therefore, is for the worker to make
himself acquainted with the art and the
handling of spinning wheels. I lay down
some simple tests for testing them. No
machine that fails to satisfy the tests
should be accepted or distributed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) The wheel must turn easily, freely,
and noiselessly.</p>

<p>(2) The turning handle must be rigidly
fixed to the axle.</p>

<p>(3) The post must be properly driven
home and joints well-fixed.</p>

<p>(4) The spindle must turn noiselessly
and without a throb in its holders.
Jarring sound cannot be avoided unless
the holders are made of knit
straw as in the Punjab, or of tough
leather.</p>

<p>(5) No machine is properly made unless
it manufactures in the hands of a
practised spinner at least 2&frac12; tolas of
even and properly twisted yarn of six
counts in an hour. I know a youngster,
who has not had more than perhaps
<span class="pb" id="Pg115">[pg 115]</span>
three months' practice, having
been able to spin 2&frac12; tolas of the above
quality of yarn in 35 minutes. No
machine should be given until it has
been worked at least full one hour in
the manner suggested and found satisfactory.</p>

<h3>THE SPINNING WHEEL<span class="pb" id="Pg116">[pg 116]</span></h3>

<p>[On February 15, 1922, Mahatma
Gandhi has addressed the following letter
to Sir Daniel Hamilton from Bardoli on
the Spinning Wheel.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Hodge writes to me to say that you
would like to have an hour's chat with me,
and he has suggested that I should open
the ground which I gladly do. I will not
take up your time by trying to interest
you in any other activity of mine except
the spinning wheel. Of all my outward
activities, I do believe that the spinning
wheel is of the most permanent and the
most beneficial. I have abundant proof
now to support my statement that the
spinning wheel will solve the problem of
economic distress in millions of India's
homes, and it constitutes an effective
insurance, against famines.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg117">[pg 117]</span>You know the great Scientist Dr.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Ray,
but you may not know that he has also
become an enthusiast on behalf of the
spinning wheel. India does not need to be
industrialized in the modern sense of the
term. It has 7,50,000 villages scattered
over a vast area 1,900 miles long, 1,500
miles broad. The people are rooted to the
soil, and the vast majority are living a
hand-to-mouth life. Whatever may be
said to the contrary, having travelled
throughout the length and breadth of the
land with eyes open, and having mixed with
millions, there can be no doubt that
pauperism is growing. There is no doubt
also that the millions are living in enforced
idleness for at least 4 months in the year.
Agriculture does not need revolutionary
changes. The Indian peasant requires a
supplementary industry. The most natural
is the introduction of the spinning wheel,
not the hand-loom. The latter cannot be
introduced in every home, whereas the
former can, and it used to be so even a
century ago. It was driven out not by
economic pressure but by force deliberately
<span class="pb" id="Pg118">[pg 118]</span>
used as can be proved from authentic
records. The restoration, therefore, of the
spinning wheel solves the economic problem
of India at a stroke. I know that you
are a lover of India, that you are deeply
interested in the economic and moral uplift
of my country. I know too that you
have great influence. I would like to enlist
it on behalf of the spinning wheel. It is the
most effective force for introducing
successful Co-Operative Societies. Without
honest co-operation of the millions,
the enterprise can never be successful,
and as it is already proving a means of
weaning thousands of women from a life
of shame, it is as moral an instrument as
it is economic.</p>

<p>I hope you will not allow yourself to be
prejudiced by anything you might have
heard about my strange views about
machinery. I have nothing to say against
the development of any other industry in
India by means of machinery but I do
say that to supply India with cloth manufactured
either outside or inside through
gigantic mills is an economic blunder of
<span class="pb" id="Pg119">[pg 119]</span>
the first magnitude just as it would be to
supply cheap bread through huge bakeries
established in the chief centres in India
and to destroy the family stove.</p>

<span class="spaced">A MODEL WEAVING-SCHOOL</span></h3>

<p>All the external activities of Satyagrahashram
in connection with Swadeshi
have for some time now been taken over
by the Gujarat Provincial Congress
Committee. People, who are in need of or
wish to know anything about ginning-wheels,
spinning-wheels, looms and Khadi,
are requested to correspond with the
Secretary of the Khadi department of that
Committee. The Ashram now only conducts
a weaving-school, which teaches all
the processes from ginning right up to
weaving. The boys of the Ashram school
are at present taking the full course of
instruction here, and we have not the room
<span class="pb" id="Pg124">[pg 124]</span>
to take up students from outside. Some
description of the work done is given here
in the hope, that it may perhaps furnish
suggestions to outside students and to
schools desirous of having spinning-classes
attached to them.</p>

<p>Forty-nine spinning wheels are here
regularly at work, over and above twenty-five
others which are reserved for beginners.
All these are worked three to six hours
per day. Some are worked for even seven
or eight hours. After a month's training,
a friend worked twelve to fourteen hours
daily for a number of days and thus proved
the possibility of earning three annas a
day. Another, a sister, spun nine to ten
hours daily for some days after finishing
her round of domestic business. In a
month and a half, she had spun enough to
get <i>sadlas</i> and other cloth woven out of
yarn spun by herself, and actually began
wearing these things. She is now-a-days
spinning at the rate of eight hours a day.
One day there was something wrong with
this lady's <i>rentia</i>. She referred the matter
to the present writer who set it right. But
<span class="pb" id="Pg125">[pg 125]</span>
she was not satisfied. She complained
again, and again was the <i>rentia</i> operated
upon. But the wheel apparently suffered
from some occult malady, which she was
at a loss to diagnose. Every time its
spinning power would get enfeebled. At
last the poor lady lost all patience and was
almost ready to weep. This was reported
to me, and this time I examined the wheel
very critically and effected a perfect cure.
It now moved merrily, and merrily did the
sister proceed with her work. It is very
desirable that all the wheels in a spinning-class
be kept in a perfect condition. When
that is the case, the spinner does not tire
and works cheerfully and speedily. Our
class is attended by five ladies, who spin
five or six hours every day, and by twenty-three
students of the Ashram school, of
whom eighteen are boys and five are girls.
The conduct of this class is not an easy
job. Their spirits are in continual need
of cheering. Some of them spin very
rapidly. But sometimes there is a grievous
attack of head-ache, at other times the
still more grievous attack of idleness.
<span class="pb" id="Pg126">[pg 126]</span>
Sometimes the hand is fatigued, at other
times the wheel gets out of repair.</p>

<p>We are now replacing the thick by a thin
spindle. It is true that with the slightest
interference or rough handling, this
thin spindle bends and begins to wobble.
But it makes the movement of the wheel
very smooth and easy, and also adds to its
speed, as the revolutions are doubled from
the fifty of the thick spindle to a hundred
in the thin spindle following from one
revolution of the large wheel. The doubling
of revolutions does not mean a double
output, but there is certainly a considerable
increase. With the thick spindle, the
wheel must go through 8 or 10 revolutions
for the drawing and winding of one length
of yarn; with the thin spindle, the revolutions
of the wheel needed for that purpose
are reduced to 4 or 5. Hence with the
thin spindle, there is an economy of labour.
The speed of drawing the yarn by the hand
is clearly limited, so that 200 or 300 revolutions
of the spindle instead of 100 would
not double or treble the speed or the output.
Advanced students draw and wind
<span class="pb" id="Pg127">[pg 127]</span>
two feet to two feet and a half of yarn
every five seconds. This comes to 8 to 10
yards a minute. If the sliver is good and
the student in a spinning-mood, there is
less breakage of yarn. Even considering
the time lost on account of breakage and
joining, some students are easily able to
spin 400 to 500 yards of yarn of about 12
counts, fit for warp. This approximates to
the speed of a mill spindle, and is therefore
quite satisfactory. When the work is over,
the student removes the spindle from the
wheel and keeps it in good preservation.
Yet accidents do occur. The class master
must know how to repair a spindle which
has thus gone wrong. He must also know
how to put the wheel in good working
order. The string which makes the spindle
revolve often breaks, but if it is well-twisted,
treated with wax, and then rubbed
well with a piece of cloth, it becomes more
durable and lasts for a number of days.</p>

<p>The students generally like to work on
the <i>rentia</i>. But the moment it gets a
little wrong and cannot be soon corrected,
they rise and flee. Not only the beginners
<span class="pb" id="Pg128">[pg 128]</span>
but even advanced scholars are sometimes
confused, when called upon to set right
such a simple machine as the spinning-wheel.
A veteran leader who set the
non-co-operating students of engineering
at work upon the spinning-wheel, made the
remark that English education has incapacitated
our young men. It was with great
pain that he said this. And it is the simple
truth of the matter. We can clearly see,
that as a result of this education, we have
not only lost the power of our hands and
feet, but we also lack in patience and perseverance.
We cannot bear to take the
trouble of correcting anything that is
wrong. Newspaper leader-writers question
the educative value of spinning and
doubt its efficacy in driving away poverty
from our midst. Their doubts would vanish
if ever they tried and saw for themselves
what children gain from the spinning-wheel.
But these writers are themselves
the product of English education. To
expect them to be patient, is to forget the
character of the discipline to which they
have been subject. There is no better test
<span class="pb" id="Pg129">[pg 129]</span>
than the spinning-wheel, if we wish to
ascertain whether our children are educated
in the real and the proper sense of that
term.</p>

<p>Many people still question the economic
value of hand spinning. But I believe
that the results of our experiments may
perhaps lead them to reconsider their
views. I will here put down the statistics
of our own class. Among our students
there are five playful children, who spin
only when the spirit possesses them. But
all of them spin good yarn fit for warp.
Hardly any spin yarn below 10 counts.
Many spin yarn of about 15 counts. Now-a-days
the boys are giving four hours to
spinning. Formerly they used to work six
hours daily, but then there was a tendency
to occasional slackness. Now we have
ruled that when once a student has spun a
length of 1000 yards, he may be allowed to
leave the spinning class, and learn carding
etc. This arrangement has had excellent
efforts. All spin without losing a moment
and spin 1000 yards in two to four hours
according to the skill acquired. And the
<span class="pb" id="Pg130">[pg 130]</span>
yarn thus produced is pretty uniform, well
twisted, and fit for warp. We have fixed a
round wire frame on the axle of the wheel
just near the handle, with a circumference
of 4 feet. This frame is used for opening
the cone into a hank. 750 revolutions of
this mean a thousand yards of yarn. Most
students count the revolutions, while they
are moving the frame, and hence do not
take much additional time for calculations.
Some are not able to practice this, and
they count the length after they have prepared
the hank.</p>

<p>1000 yards of yarn of six counts weigh
8 <i>tolas</i>. (840 yards make a hank. If six
such hanks weigh a pound, the yarn is of 6
counts. Hence 840 yards of six count of
yarn weigh 6&#8532; <i>tolas</i>.) 4 annas is a quite
proper wage for spinning one pound of
six-count yarn of a standard quality. This
means a wage of nine pies and a half for
spinning 8 <i>tolas</i>. But most of our students
spin yarn of 12 to 15 counts, and even finer.
And this is quite good and fit for weaving.
The wage for a thousand yards of finer yarn
must be proportionately higher; as the
<span class="pb" id="Pg131">[pg 131]</span>
finer the yarn, the greater the number of
twists to be given to it. Twelve-count
yarn requires nearly half as much twisting
again as six-count yarn. Hence the
wage of a thousand yards of twelve-count
yarn must be half as much again as
that of the same length of six-count yarn.
But this proportionately higher wage
makes the hand-spun yarn much dearer
than the mill-made yarn of the same
count. If we take 8 and 12 annas to be the
wage for spinning a pound of yarn of 12
and 16 counts respectively, the wage for
spinning a length of 1000 yards of the same
counts will be 10 or 11 pies. One student
spins this amount in 2 hours, several in 3
hours and the rest in 4.</p>

<p>On the last <i>Amavasya</i> it was twenty
two days since the students set regularly
to work after the <i>vaishaka</i> vacation.
Deducting three holidays on Sundays and
three half-holidays on Wednesdays, we get
seventeen and a half working days. There
was an average attendance of twenty two
students out of twenty three. Twenty
two students spun in seventeen days and
<span class="pb" id="Pg132">[pg 132]</span>
a half twenty four <i>shers</i> and a half of yarn
of about fourteen counts. If we take
ten annas to be the average wage for spinning
a <i>sher</i>, this comes to fifteen rupees
and four annas. This is exclusive of Rs.&nbsp;1&ndash;11&ndash;0
which is the wage of 18 pounds of
cotton carded and made into slivers by one
student in 12 days, calculated at an anna
and a half per pound. It is also exclusive
of the extra work put in by students on five
or six days after finishing their daily quota
of 1000 yds. of yarn by way of carding
and opening yarn for weaving tapes and
carpets. These students gave some of
their private time also to this work.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, that the figures will
mount higher when the students acquire
the habit of methodical work. But whatever
the pecuniary value of their work
might be, method in work itself will be an
<ins class="corr" title="acpuisition" id="C132">acquisition</ins> beyond all price.</p>

<p>So much for the spinning department. I
hope to be able to deal with the weaving
department on another occasion.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Y. I.&mdash;21st July 1921.</i></p>

<hr  />

<h3>SPINNING DEPARTMENT<span class="pb" id="Pg133">[pg 133]</span></h3>

<p>I should like to add a few more facts
about the spinning department, before I
come to weaving.</p>

<p>In <i>Ashadha</i> the students were more
energetic than before. The number of
regular students was 21, and these in 23
working days (there being six holidays in
the month) spun 30 pounds and 24 <i>tolas</i>
of yarn of about 12 counts on the average,
fit for warp. At ten annas a pound, this
means a wage of Rs.&nbsp;19&ndash;2&ndash;0. The total
number of hours of spinning was 1337. At
4 hours a day it should have been 1932 (23
number of days × 21 number of students × 4).
This deficiency is not due to idleness, nor
to headache. Complaints of idleness have
now quite ceased. And students now
understand that headache may prevent one
from reading or working sums but not from
spinning. They have also realised that if
<span class="pb" id="Pg134">[pg 134]</span>
the arms are fatigued by fetching water or
swimming, there is nothing like spinning
for removing the fatigue. The thing is
that those students who have mastered
spinning were engaged in carding and
other process. If full time had been given
to spinning, we would have turned out a
proportionately bigger quantity of yarn.</p>

<p>The spinning power of the students is
increasing every day. The <ins class="corr" title="students" id="C134">student</ins> who
spun 7 <i>tolas</i> an hour during the Satyagraha
week is now no longer a prodigy and others
are fast overtaking him. One day a girl
spun 9 <i>tolas</i> of uniform and well-twisted
12-count yarn in 6 hours. At the above
rate this means a wage of 2 annas 3 pies. For
8 hours therefore the wage would be 3
annas, for 12 hours 4 annas <ins class="corr" title="6pies" id="C134a">6 pies</ins>, for 14
hours 5 annas 3 pies. But it is hardly
necessary to emphasise the pecuniary value
of the work, so far as schools are concerned.
The point is that by constituting spinning
as a permanent part of our school curricula
we provide manual training of the highest
kind and at the same time prepare for the
re-advent of a day when spinning will be
<span class="pb" id="Pg135">[pg 135]</span>
as much a part of our domestic economy
as say cooking.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Y. I.&mdash;11th Aug. '21.</i></p>

<hr  />

<h3>THE ADVANTAGE OF THE THIN SPINDLE<span class="pb" id="Pg136">[pg 136]</span></h3>

<p>Since we introduced the thin Spindle, we
have been keeping a number of them in
reserve. When a student has his spindle
bent, it is not corrected there and then but
he is at once given one of the spare good
ones, so there is no delay. Afterwards all
the spindles that have gone wrong are
collected and corrected together.</p>

<p>The <i>sadi</i>, i.e. the wrapping on the spindle
which serves as a pulley, is often cut
by itself and has sometimes to be cut off
in order to correct the spindle. A new <i>sadi</i>
has to be wrapped and for this a bottle of
thick gum is kept ready at hand. It must
be made of fine strong yarn, and be wrapped
very tight. If it is loose, the string which
revolves the spindle (<i>mala</i>) sinks in it and
cuts it <ins class="corr" title="as under" id="C136">asunder</ins>, and at once the spindle
stops. If the <i>sadi</i> is made of coarse yarn,
<span class="pb" id="Pg137">[pg 137]</span>
it becomes rough, and so the <i>mala</i> does not
run smoothly, and the spindle throbs and
causes breakage of the yarn while it is
being spun.</p>

<p>Pairs of <i>chamarakhan</i> (leather-bearing)
also are kept in reserve. When these
become too soft by an excess of oiling or
by rough handling, they must be changed.
Now-a-days we make them from raw hides
and not from leather or bamboo, and so
they keep longer.</p>

<p>Formerly a round piece of wood or cardboard
used to serve as a rest for winding
the cone. But now we have substituted
a piece of horn which is more durable.
Wax is kept in stock for treating the <i>mala</i>.
Besides these things we have a small
oil-can, a pen-knife, a hammer, a chisel,
and a small anvil.</p>

<p>The students bring the hank twisted hard
in the shape of a stick. The hank weighs
two <i>tolas</i>, which is the standard weight of
the sliver provided. A bigger hank causes
trouble while we open it, and the yarn is
spoilt. The yarn spun by each student is
kept separate with his name upon a wooden
<span class="pb" id="Pg138">[pg 138]</span>
tag attached to it. Every student is asked
to stick to one particular count all along till
he has spun out enough for a length of warp;
and then the yarn is sent to the weaving
department. Every one is anxious to see
when his yarn is sent out for weaving. Three
such lengths of warp are being woven at
present. About seven are ready waiting
to be woven. An eleven year old girl will
soon get a piece 20 yards long and 42 inches
wide out of yarn spun by herself in the
course of three months. This will provide
her with <ins class="corr" title="too" id="C138">two</ins> suits of clothing of two small
<i>sadis</i>, 2 blouses and 2 petticoats. Her
father had put in a pound of yarn spun by
himself, to finish up the piece, and in return
for this, she is going to spare a <i>dhoti</i> for
him too. She is as much pleased to see
the cloth woven from her own yarn as most
<ins class="corr" title="girl" id="C138a">girls</ins> would be to see brocade. Two other girls
have combined their stock of yarn and are
daily asking for it to be woven. Those
students who have passed out from the
spinning class are engaged in other departments,
and have not much time to spare for
spinning; so they work on holidays and
<span class="pb" id="Pg139">[pg 139]</span>
prepare woof for their own warps, which
are waiting to be woven. So in the second
month, the spinning department is in full
swing.</p>

<h3>HAND-LOOMS<span class="pb" id="Pg140">[pg 140]</span></h3>

<p>The working of the spinning class
having been fully described in the first two
articles, the process next to be taken up is
carding; but having received a number of
queries as to the working of hand-looms, I
propose to deal with this before going into
intermediate processes.</p>

<p>Questions are asked as to which will be
the most useful loom for weaving hand-spun
yarn. Some want our opinion about
the automatic looms; others insist upon
the necessity of inventing a new swift-working
machine, while still others ask for
monetary help to prepare such after their
own designs.</p>

<p>My humble but firm opinion is that the
old pit-loom is the best, especially for
weaving hand-spun yarn. No doubt it is
the slowest working instrument but is the
surest of all, and just as our old spinning-wheel
<span class="pb" id="Pg141">[pg 141]</span>
in spite of its being the slowest
instrument is absolutely capable of spinning
out all the cotton that India produces
to-day, so the old pit-loom is
perfectly capable of weaving out all the
yarn that India can produce by means of
the spinning wheels and the mills.</p>

<p>This is not the time to enter into the
figures in support of my statement. I
shall only try to show the usefulness of the
pit-loom. The fly-shuttle loom has its
place in the sphere of home industry as
well as of the factory, but the automatic
looms have no room in this industry. Its
drawbacks can only be realized by a study
of the facts and figures regarding concerns
which employ such looms. People who
newly take up this industry should beware
of flashy advertisements. They should not
be misled by professed calculations of the
working of such looms.</p>

<p>The fly-shuttle looms have varying adjustments.
In the Muzzaffarpur spinning
and weaving exhibition held in May last,
a party from this school was present with
its wheel and loom. Of all the fly-shuttle
<span class="pb" id="Pg142">[pg 142]</span>
looms exhibited, the one from this school
was selected as the simplest and lightest
of all. It is all made of wood, with the
exception of nails and screws required for
joining. The pickers are also made
entirely of wood. The shuttle and perns
are home-made. Other looms had iron
bars in their boxes, were operated with
foreign shuttles, and their perns were
unwieldy. Our loom is modelled upon a
type of looms working in thousands in the
Madras Presidency. The whole loom with
a wooden frame to fit on a pit, with the
exception of the <ins class="corr" title="hields" id="C142">shields</ins> and reed costs Rs. <ins class="corr" title="45" id="C142a">45.</ins>
These latter things are not supplied, as
there is no fixed standard of the yarn to
be used on it.</p>

<p>I wish some public spirited person or
firm will come forward in Madras or elsewhere
in that presidency and undertake
to supply the fly-shuttle loom as described
above promptly and at reasonable rates.
Any one desirous of taking up this work
may correspond with the head of the <i>Khadi</i>
Department, Gujarat Provincial Congress
<ins class="corr" title="Commitee" id="C142b">Committee</ins> Ahmedabad.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg143">[pg 143]</span>Thus far as regards the fly-shuttle looms.
I suggest to new manufacturers that they
cannot do better than start with the old
fashioned pit-looms. It is our experience
that on account of less breakage of yarn,
especially hand-spun yarn, the output of a
pit-loom almost equals and in some cases
even exceeds that of the fly-shuttle loom.
In weaving broader width, however, the
fly-shuttle is certainly more convenient.
And when the hand-spun yarn is of good
test, it enjoys a decided advantage over
the old loom in point of swiftness. But
we have to remember that we have got to
deal with hand-spun yarn which is not
likely to have a good test for some time to
come. It is therefore that the old loom
is the safest and surest weaving instrument
to go on with for the present.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Y. I.&mdash;25th Aug. 1921.</i></p>

<h3>WHAT KIND OF LOOM?<span class="pb" id="Pg144">[pg 144]</span></h3>

<p>Questions are asked as to the production
of cloths in an old-fashioned loom from
handspun yarn. The experience in our
school is, that a well-practised worker
weaves on a pit-loom one yard cloth of 30
inches width and of fairly thick texture in
one hour. Cloth of greater or smaller
width varies in proportion. Our fly-shuttle
pit-loom has not exceeded this figure in
handspun yarn so far. When formerly we
used mill-made yarn, it yielded about half
as much cloth again as the old pit-loom.
However in weaving <i>dhotiyans</i> and <i>sadis</i>
from handspun as well as mill-made yarn
the flyshuttle is very handy.</p>

<p>Then there is a question as to the necessity
of beaming the yarn. We believe,
that where there is no question of room,
beaming should be dispensed with. Hand-loom
weaving factories situated in thickly
<span class="pb" id="Pg145">[pg 145]</span>
populated towns where rates of house-rent
are very high, have reason to resort to beaming;
but where space allows stretching of
the yarn as practised by the professional
weavers, it is a time-saving method and is
artistic as well. There is an argument in
favour of beaming that it allows of the
handling of warp as long as 200 or even
300 yards. But if such length of handspun
yarn can be prepared, it is equally easy, if
not easier, to stretch it in the old style.</p>

<hr />

<h3>SIZING HANDSPUN YARN<span class="pb" id="Pg146">[pg 146]</span></h3>

<p>It is said, that the difficulty of sizing
handspun yarn is a serious handicap from
which the movement suffers. As a matter
of fact, the method of sizing it should be
no different from that of sizing mill-made
yarn. It is slipshod spinning which is at
the bottom of this difficulty. The best way
out of it is to organise and improve the
production of handspun yarn. It is superstition
to say that the yarn spun on the
<i>charkha</i> cannot be strong and even. Where
proper care is taken, it does improve and
even surpass mill-made yarn in some
respects. Punjab and Marwad, where
spinning has been carried on from past
times, have also to improve their yarn.
Not that the spinners there do not know
their work, but they as well as the merchants
who purchase their yarn are careless
about the quality of the yarn turned
out. Unless this work is taken up by men
imbued with the true Swadeshi spirit, the
condition is not likely to improve. The
spinners should be visited at their work
<span class="pb" id="Pg147">[pg 147]</span>
from time to time, and proper instructions
as to the required twist and test to be
given to the yarn should be imparted to
them. The payment of a reasonably
higher wage than the present is another
way of improving the yarn. The wages we
have arranged for our guidance are given
below in the form of a table. Where living
is cheaper than in Gujarat, they can be
adjusted accordingly. The yarn having
improved, the difficulty of sizing will disappear.</p>

<p>When a country weaver shows inability
to weave hand-spun yarn, it means that he
cannot weave it in the same reed space as
he uses for the mill-made yarn. This is
quite evident. The hand-spun yarn not
being even, it requires wider reed space.
The table given below also shows the
number of ends of different counts to be
drawn in an inch of a reed. Then if the
cloth to be woven is meant for shirting or
coating and not for <i>dhotiyan</i> or <i>sadi</i>, and
if the yarn has a good test, two to four
ends can be added to the number denoted
in the table.</p>

</table>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg149">[pg 149]</span>If the yarn is very weak and uneven, it
should be woven with two ends in warp as
well as in weft. This will give a strong
texture to the cloth, making the process of
weaving easy at the same time. The proportion
in this case of ends to be drawn in
an inch of the reed space is also given in
the above table. If this course is adopted,
heaps of handspun yarn that have accumulated
all over the country can be woven out
without much difficulty.</p>

<p>As a fact, the method of sizing traditionally
followed by the weavers cannot be
improved upon. Their selection of the
sizing material is appropriate to the
climate, season and circumstances. For
the most part they use the staple corn.
Jawari and maize being the cheapest are
used in many parts. In the rainy season,
however, they use wheat flour as a stronger
sizing material to counteract the over-softening
influence of the moisture present
in the air. In the Madras Presidency, a
cereal called <i>ragi</i> with a yellowish flour is
used for coarse counts, while rice is used
for finer counts. Rice and wheat are the
<span class="pb" id="Pg150">[pg 150]</span>
best ingredients for sizing. The proportion
used is from 10 per cent required for
fine yarn to 20 per cent for coarse yarn.</p>

<p>Different preparations of various sizing
materials are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wheat</i>: Weigh the warp first. Then
according to its fineness or coarseness,
take fine wheat flour or <i>Menda</i> from 10 to
20 per cent of its weight, knead it well with
water to form a thin paste, taking care
that no lump remains. Boil some water
just enough to soak the warp, then add the
paste previously prepared and keep on
stirring till the granules are well-cooked
and the whole substance is reduced to the
form of thin gruel. To every such preparation
of one pound of flour, one ounce
of sesamum or sweet oil should be added.
This will give softness and smoothness to
the threads of the warp and keep them
from sticking to one another. Cocoanut or
castor oil is also used as a lubricant. Any
of these is good, except only that the
castor oil will give a bad odour and a dull
colour to the warp. The size thus prepared
is then slowly poured on to the warp, which
<span class="pb" id="Pg151">[pg 151]</span>
is kept folded on a gunny cloth or a clean
slab. The warp is beaten with both the
hands, while the process of pouring is
going on, and when it is thoroughly saturated
all over, it is spread out in the open
and brushed repeatedly in one direction,
often bringing the down side up till it gets
dried. One or two or more persons according
to the length of the warp are engaged
in brushing, while several others are joining
broken threads and shifting the sticks in
the warp from one lease to another.</p>

<p>This is the most thorough of all the
methods of sizing. The ends of fibres lying
loose on every thread of the warp are
straightened, and stuck fast round the
thread by the process of brushing. The
thread is rendered smooth and strong like
wire, and the work of weaving is made all
the easier by it. Thus swiftness in weaving
is ensured. To master this requires long
practice but it is worth the while of every
student to do so. For an energetic youth
about three hours' work under an expert
every morning for two months or so is
sufficient. With two assistants or more he
<span class="pb" id="Pg152">[pg 152]</span>
will then be able to manage the brush-sizing
himself without the aid of an expert. A
less active person will take four or six
months' practice.</p>

<p>The preparation of size from jawari and
maize flour is just the same as from wheat
flour, except that the flour of these cereals
not being so fine as wheat flour, a larger
quantity is required in their case.</p>

<p>Some people advise that wheat flour
should be soaked for at least two days
before it is boiled with water. It is said
that the adherent quality of the flour is
enhanced by this process.</p>

<p><i>Rice.</i> The preparation from rice is simpler
still. The required quantity of rice is
boiled well with a quantity of water larger
than that used for ordinary cooking and is
allowed to remain for 12 to 24 hours. It
is then strained through a piece of cloth
tied over or into the mouth of a large
vessel, more water being added as required
in the process of straining. The strained
matter is then reduced to consistent thinness;
then oil is added to it in proportion
as described above.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg153">[pg 153]</span>Rice is sometimes preferred to wheat, as
it gives besides strength a fine gloss to the
warp.</p>

<p>The thing to be borne in mind is that
the yarn meant for preparing warp must
be made thoroughly absorbent beforehand.
For this, all the hanks must be connected
in the form of one chain. It is then folded
together, placed into a big vessel, whether
of earth or metal, containing water enough
to soak the yarn and then well pressed
with both the feet for some time. It is
left in this condition for two or three days,
during which period it is beaten with a
wooden club on a slab twice every day. It
should be remembered that, unless it is
beaten, it does not soak through for days.
If it is not soaked well, it is incapable
of absorbing the sizing material, and is
imperfectly sized. The cotton fibre has a
natural oily coating on it, which is removed
by soaking it as described before or by
boiling it for some time. It does not become
thoroughly absorbent, till it is treated
in this manner. After two or three days,
when the yarn is well soaked, the chain is
<span class="pb" id="Pg154">[pg 154]</span>
opened out and dried in shade, every
hank being hung separately on a bamboo.
Before it gets completely dried, it is well
shaken with both the hands twice or
thrice, so that the threads do not stick to
one another. The Madrasi weavers are
used to pouring rice water (generally
thrown away when the rice is boiled) on
the yarn, before it is dried out in the
manner described above. This gives
greater strength to the yarn, and causes
less breakage in the process of winding
and preparing it into warp.</p>

<p>The other method of sizing resorted to
by the weavers is called hank-sizing. It is
an easy process, and though not so efficient
as brush-sizing, it answers well if carefully
performed. In this case the yarn, before
it is made up into a warp, is soaked, hank
by hank, into the size prepared from wheat
or rice as described above, and after pressing
off the size a little from the hank
with the thumb and a finger, the hank, wet
as it is, is wound up on a bobbin. The
warp is prepared immediately while the
bobbin is wet, each thread drying on the
<span class="pb" id="Pg155">[pg 155]</span>
warping sticks as soon as another is
drawn out. The warp thus prepared is fit
for weaving.</p>

<p>We have tried hank-sizing in a weak
solution of ordinary gum. It works well
in dry season, but makes the yarn moist
in wet season on account of its absorbent
quality.</p>

<span class="spaced">THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Gandhi during his visit to Assam
and Eastern Bengal has observed, that the
type of <i>charkha</i> in use in those parts is
deficient in many ways. The same is
perhaps the case in other provinces.
As we believe that the <i>charkha</i> in the
Satyagrahashram is a model of its kind, we
give below a diagram with measurements
of all its parts with an explanation of their
relative functions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
   <img src="images/wheel.jpg" width="450" height="277" id="wheel"
      alt="" title="spinning wheel" />
</div>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg157">[pg 157]</span>The rear base with mark <i>1</i> is one foot 9
inches long, 4 inches wide and 3 inches high.</p>

<p>The front base with mark <i>2</i> is 9 inches
long, 4 inches wide and 3 inches high.</p>

<p>The long piece which joins the two
bases, marked <i>3</i>, is 3 feet long (including
joints), 3 inches wide and 2 inches high.</p>

<p>The large uprights marked <i>4</i> are 1 foot 6
inches long including joints, 2 inches wide,
and 3 inches deep. They are fixed on the
back base 9 inches apart. The holes in
which the axle rests are made 2 inches
below the top. These holes contain
bearings of thin iron plates to secure easy
motion of the axle. The bearings are kept
open at the top to allow access of oil
through a slanting hole bored on the outward
sides of both the uprights, one inch
above the axle.</p>

<p>The small uprights marked <i>5</i> are 9
inches long with joints 1&frac12; inches wide
and 1&frac12; inches deep, with holes 4 inches
below the top to contain the leather bearings
which bear the spindle. They are
fixed 3 inches apart on the front base
and are connected together 2 inches above
<span class="pb" id="Pg158">[pg 158]</span>
the base with a piece of a wood of the
same thickness. This joining piece
contains in the middle 2 sticks half an
inch apart to regulate the position of the
<i>mala</i> (the string which revolves the spindle)
on the spindle.</p>

<p>Another piece marked <i>6</i> and joined
parallelly to the left upright is meant to
bear a hole for leather bearing when a thin
spindle is to be used.</p>

<p>The drum or wheel consists of 8 planks
such as the one marked <i>7</i>, each being 2 feet
long, 4 inches wide and &frac34; inch thick.
They are divided in two wings of 4 planks
each, each containing two couples of planks
joined diametrically with a groove in the
middle.</p>

<p>Both the wings are nailed on to the
wooden shaft marked <i>8</i>, its size being 4&frac12;
inches long and 4 inches diameter.</p>

<p>Through the middle of this shaft passes
a long round iron bar, which serves as an
axle. It is 19 inches long and half an
inch thick. Its end, where the handle is
fixed is made square to ensure firmness of
the handle.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg159">[pg 159]</span>A wooden washer one inch thick is fixed
to the axle on either side of the drum to
avoid its contact with the uprights.</p>

<p>The handle is shaped put of a wooden
piece of 2 inches × 2 inches × 1&frac12; feet
long.</p>

<p>The reel noticed in the diagram between
the drum and the handle is composed of a
wooden disc marked <i>9</i> made out of 1 inch
thick and 6 inches square piece of wood.
Six brackets made of galvanized wire of
10 gauge radiate from the centre of the
disc so as to make a circumference of
4 feet. The brackets are fixed in the back
of the disc with bent ends and are further
secured with small nails near the circumference
of the disc.</p>

<p>A wire noose is fixed on the back base
just below the reel to regulate the yarn
when wound up on the reel from a bobbin
or directly from the spindle.</p>

<p>A 4 inches long bamboo pin is fixed in
the inward side of the front base parallelly
to the long plank marked 3. It is meant
to hold the bobbin while opening out yarn
from it. When the yarn is opened from
<span class="pb" id="Pg160">[pg 160]</span>
the spindle directly, it is held in the left
hand with the point towards the reel. The
right hand is employed in turning the reel
by the handle of the <i>charkha</i>.</p>

<p>The figure <i>10</i>, indicates the position of
the spinner.</p>
